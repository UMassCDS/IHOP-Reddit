MBTI is the short form for Myers Briggs Type Indicator, a personality test from the US created by Myers and Briggs based on the works of world famous psychologist, psychiatrist and philosopher Carl G. Jung.\nThere are 16 different personality types, that result from stacking the Cognitive Functions (find out more about it here -> r/CognitiveFunctions ) in different ways.\nThe eight Jungian Cognitive Functions are Extroverted and Introverted Intuition (Ne and Ni), Extroverted and Introverted Sensing (Se and Si), Extroverted and Introverted Thinking (Te and Ti) and Extroverted and Introverted Feeling (Fe and Fi).\nThe sixteen personality types are as follows: ENTP, ENTJ, ENFP, ENFJ, INTP, INTJ, INFP, INFJ, ESTP, ESTJ, ESFP, ESFJ, ISTP, ISTJ, ISFP and ISFJ.\nWe have created communities / subreddits for memes about every type, simply visit r/TYPEmemes for a list with easy to click links to all of them.\nEnjoy !"}]}
