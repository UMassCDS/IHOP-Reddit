The quality is worse than IPS or good TN. This is the case for many 1080p displays that aren't listed as IPS or 120Hz+, and nearly all displays 768p/900p.\nComparison pictures: 1, 2, 3, 4\nNotable models:\nMany Thinkpads, Latitudes, Probooks with base screen options\nThere may be other concerns too such as colorspace and response times. Many IPS displays are passable but still not great. A more in-depth article is in the works, and will be linked here.\nFalse High-Res Displays\nSome laptops that list high resolutions (1440p through 4K) use \"PenTile\" RG/BW or WR/GB matrix panels instead of RGB/RGB. These trick consumers because the listed resolution numbers are the same, but the detail is less, and they produce artifacts. Companies tend to use these only in the place of higher resolutions where an unsuspecting customer may not immediately realize something is wrong.\nNotable models with false high-res displays:\nEUROCOM Tornado F5/F5W/X4C\nClevo w/ Samsung/LG '4K' 15.6\"\nNote: Sharp and OLED Samsung panels are true 4K."},{"header":"Helpful Guides/Links","description":"/r/Laptops' Wiki and Quick Picks\nWhat to avoid when buying laptops (by /u/LonerIM2)\nAffiliate/Retailer/Reseller Rules\nWhere to buy a Clevo/Sager?\nMobile Graphics Comparison Chart\nMobile Processor Comparison Chart\nGaming Performance, Mobile Graphics\nShopineer\nLaptop vs. Laptop by /u/qkls\nProduct Chart Laptops\nGaming Laptops Junky\n/u/construktz's Lappy List\nGaming Laptop Buyer's Guide\nLaptop List by /u/LonerIM2"}]}
