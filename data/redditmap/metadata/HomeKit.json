While we allow questions and problems you have, we hope that you try to solve them on your own. r/HomeKit values news, reviews, discussions, and How-tos. High-level problems that a lot of people have are also valued. Some useful resources for solving your own problem/question can be found below. If you cannot solve your own problem or question, then you can make a post about it.\nRemember to put 'What to buy?' and 'Should I buy?' questions in the sticked megathread."}]}
