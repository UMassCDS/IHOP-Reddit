Read more.\nYour memes should do its best to be about something about hockey.\nWe follow the /r/dankmemes rules of meme submitting. For example: There is a difference between comedy and outright hate speech, but ironic hate speech is still hate speech. No memes about violent tragedies or anything that could be seen as glorifying violence. This also includes (but is not limited to) memes regarding: Deaths, terrorist attacks, rape, sexual assault, pedo, murder, war, bombings, and school shootings. Please no politics, unless some how relevant to a current hockey news story."}]}
