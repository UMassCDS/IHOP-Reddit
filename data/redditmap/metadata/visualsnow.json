The researchers stated that pinpointing visual snow (and its related symptoms such as afterimages) to a functional problem in a specific brain area may open up possibilities for targeted treatment and that treatment trials will follow."},{"header":"WARNING","description":"Although some members are knowledgeable about Visual Snow please do not take all that is posted as fact.
