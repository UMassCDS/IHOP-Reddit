As a third-generation blockchain platform powered by the EOS virtual machine, EOS has an extensible WebAssembly engine for deterministic execution of near fee-less transactions.\nEOS is the market's most scalable, divisible, and programmable digital currency. EOS is a Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS) network where stakeholders have the authority to select node operators. Due to the decentralized nature of the token distribution on EOS, power doesn't reside in the hands of block miners, but rather all parties involved in the EOS Network.\nThe EOS Network is attractive because of its technology and community. It allows developers to build projects that other blockchains cannot support. The network is straightforward and has multiple tools and educational resources to help users acclimate to the blockchain.\nQuick Links:\nOfficial Website EOS Public chain EOSnetwork.com\nOfficial EOS Community Support EOSsupport.io\nLearning Center help.eossupport.io\nOfficial Forum EOS Community forums.eoscommunity.org\nEOS Support and Tutorials https://eosio.support/\nOfficial Website Eden (Political Playoffs on EOS) edeneos.org wiki.eoscommunity.org\nOfficial Website Immortal Webhosting on EOS EOStemplateone.com/\nInflation problems in your country? eosmarketplace.io eosmicroloan.com\nList of helpful EOS links: Tutorials, Walkthroughs, Guides\nAll EOS Tokens Market Cap: EOSGO.io\nHigh liquidity exchanges/swaps: Newdex.io DefiBox.io Defis.Network nsx.finance\nHardware wallet support: Ledger\nPopular dapps: DappRadar\nDebunking FUD and wrong information around EOS: Link\nlist of awesome EOSIO resources for developers and more! https://github.com/DanailMinchev/awesome-eosio#developers\nEOS Wallets:\nGreymass Anchor Wallet\nWombat\nTokenPocket\nSimplEOS\nMyKey\nScatter (outdated, no more support)\nOther Links:\nEOS Github\nAntelopeIO Github - Community fork of the EOSIO codebase\nEOS General Telegram Chat\nEOS/Antelope developer chat\nNode infrastructure provider\nWhitepaper\nBluepapers\nEOS vote rewards GenPool.io\nRelated Subreddit:\n/r/eosdev : EOS dApps & Development\nEOS Decentralized Finance (DeFi):\nEOS Rex (built into EOS base layer)\nDefibox DeFi Platform\nDeFis Network DeFi Platform\nEOSX DeFi Portal\nEOSDT Decentralized stablecoin\nOrganix Synthetic assets on EOS\nPizza Stablecoin & Financial Platform\nVigor Borrow / Lend / Insure Platform\nSwapzone Instant non-custodial ex—Åhange aggregator\nxNation\nOther EOSIO Networks:\n/r/Boscore : Boscore\n/r/EOSfinex : EOSfinex\n/r/EuropeChain : EuropeChain\n/r/officialFIO : FIO\n/r/Meetone : Meet.one\n/r/ProtonChain : Proton\n/r/Remme : Remme\n/r/Telos : Telos\n/r/Ultra_io : Ultra\n/r/WAX_io : WAX"}]}
