Include screenshots (not pictures taken of screens) of the issue. If you aren't sure what to include, more is better!\nCheck the Wiki, read the sidebar, and search before posting a question, as it may already have been answered.\nIf your post doesn't appear in the new section, it may be caught in the spam filter. If this happens, message the moderators to ask them to check the spam filter.\nWhen posting a picture please use a screenshot instead of a picture taken of a screen by your phone. This means the quality will increase and will be easier to understand the picture and problem.\nPrison Architect Discord"}]}
