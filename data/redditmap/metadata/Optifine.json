(yes, that second one is real. it's just not kept up-to-date)\nThere are many websites that attempt to copy the OptiFine website, or otherwise just plainly redistribute OptiFine illegally. Their downloads may be packaged with malware, adware, trojans, and many other bad things. Be aware of what sites you're visiting, and always try to check and scan your downloads before using them. Note that all versions of OptiFine are packaged as JAR files, not as EXE. If you download OptiFine and it comes as an EXE, DO NOT RUN IT.\nStay safe, everyone.\nRead more about the StopModReposts movement: https://stopmodreposts.org/"}]}
