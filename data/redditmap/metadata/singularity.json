This community studies the creation of superintelligenceâ€” and predict it will happen in the near future, and that ultimately, deliberate action ought to be taken to ensure that the Singularity benefits humanity.\nOn the Technological Singularity\nThe technological singularity, or simply the singularity, is a hypothetical moment in time when artificial intelligence will have progressed to the point of a greater-than-human intelligence. Because the capabilities of such an intelligence may be difficult for a human to comprehend, the technological singularity is often seen as an occurrence (akin to a gravitational singularity) beyond which the future course of human history is unpredictable or even unfathomable.\nThe first use of the term \"singularity\" in this context was by mathematician John von Neumann. The term was popularized by science fiction writer Vernor Vinge, who argues that artificial intelligence, human biological enhancement, or brain-computer interfaces could be possible causes of the singularity. Futurist Ray Kurzweil predicts the singularity to occur around 2045 whereas Vinge predicts some time before 2030.\nProponents of the singularity typically postulate an \"intelligence explosion\", where superintelligences design successive generations of increasingly powerful minds, that might occur very quickly and might not stop until the agent's cognitive abilities greatly surpass that of any human.\nResources\nMachine Intelligence Research Institute\nLessWrong\nFollow us at on twitter\nFuture of Humanity Institute\nH+Pedia\nPosting Rules\n1) On-topic posts\n2) Discussion posts encouraged\n3) No Self-Promotion/Advertising\n4) Be respectful\nCheck out /r/Singularitarianism and the Technological Singularity FAQ"}]}
