Read The FAQ Before Posting\nDo your part. Check the FAQ and do a search of previous posts before posting to r/keto.\n2. Stay on Topic / No Cheat Posts\nStay on topic. Off topic posts include: cheat posts, posts about other diets/others that are not eating keto, \"farewell\" posts/posts asking how to stop keto and resume a \"normal\" diet, Ranting, etc. Please keep these in the community support thread on the main page.\n2.a: Why no cheat posts? In addition to being off-topic, cheat posts are specifically against the rules of this subreddit because they are negative, defeatist, and can serve as a trigger to those who are struggling.\n3. Be respectful and accurate\nPersonal attacks, threats, inappropriate/sexual comments, thread crapping, fear mongering, intellectual dishonesty, posting misinformation, gatekeeping, excessively aggressive posting, and sexualizing/insulting/minimizing posts on progress pictures will not be allowed.\nThese sorts of posts may result in a permanent ban with no prior warning. Please see the Community Guidelines for a more detailed explanation of what types of comments are in violation of this rule.\n3.a: Zero tolerance will be afforded to posts containing racism, sexism, homophobia, transphobia, or other identity-based slurs (i.e., insulting a person's ability/disability, looks, etc.).\n4. No Low Effort Posts\nLow effort posts will be removed. This includes: title-only posts, posts with under 200 characters including those that contain only links to articles or images/memes, posts asking questions that are explicitly answered in the FAQ, etc. Save your memes for r/ketocirclejerk\n5. No Self Promotion / Spam\nSelf promotion includes: posts linking to or containing personal blogs/channels/websites/social media pages/watermarks, affiliate/referral links, or surveys for market research or educational purposes. If you are posting progress pictures with a watermark we ask that the watermark contain your Reddit username only.\n6.
