Subsequent offenses after a warning has already been issued can result in further punitive action, at the mods discretion, including issuing lifetime bans.\nIf you believe you may be an experiencer, or an abductee, we encourage you to post the details and recollections of your personal experiences and include any photos/videos of any skin marks, burns, etc. as well as any other supporting evidence and/or helpful information that maybe helpful to potential investigators, researchers & fellow experiencers.
