It will do this for threads that contain a \"goodbye\" that meets the comment score threshold. It runs every hour on the hour (roughly).\nGoodbye threshold: 10 points\n(This is just the default... check the Ouija Configuration Guide for information on how to customize this value for your post.)\nHelp! The flair on my post is missing or incorrect! What should I do?\nIf you think the Ouija Bot should take another look at your post, report the post (not the Goodbye) as \"Missing or Incorrect Flair\". (Update: Due to changes in the reporting UI, you may need to select the category \"it breaks /r/AskOuija's rules\" in order to select \"Missing or Incorrect Flair\".) Once you've reported your post, the Ouija Bot will reprocess it the next time it runs.\nRemember, you need a Goodbye with at least 10 points to have your thread flaired. If you want to lower this threshold, you can add a minscore setting to your post. For more info on this, check out the Ouija configuration guide."}]}
