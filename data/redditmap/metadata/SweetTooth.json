Unsure if hybrids are the cause or result of the virus, many humans fear and hunt them. After a decade of living safely in his secluded forest home, a sheltered hybrid deer-boy named Gus (Christian Convery) unexpectedly befriends a wandering loner named Jepperd (Nonso Anozie). Together they set out on an extraordinary adventure across what is left of America in search of answers—about Gus' origins, Jepperd's past, and the true meaning of home. But their story is full of unexpected allies and enemies, and Gus quickly learns the lush, dangerous world outside the forest is more complex than he ever could have imagined."},{"header":"Cast and characters","description":"Christian Convery as Gus\nNonso Anozie as Tommy Jepperd\nAdeel Akhtar as Dr. Singh\nWill Forte as Gus' father\nDania Ramirez as Amy\nNeil Sandilands as General Steven Abbot\nStefania LaVie Owen as Bear\nAliza Vellani as Rani Singh\nJames Brolin as The Narrator"},{"header":"Episode Discussions","description":"Season 1 - General Discussion\nEpisode 1 - Out of the Deep Woods\nEpisode 2 - Sorry About All the Dead People\nEpisode 3 - Weird Deer Shit\nEpisode 4 - Special Sauce\nEpisode 5 - What's in the Freezer?\nEpisode 6 - Stranger Danger on a Train\nEpisode 7 - When Pubba Met Birdie\nEpisode 8 - Big Man"}]}
