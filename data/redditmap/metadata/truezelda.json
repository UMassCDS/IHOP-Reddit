For example, starting a discussion about a particular game would be a fine topic for a self-post, but should not be initiated by posting an image of its box-art.\nWhy is this place called /r/TrueZelda?\nIt was a common naming pattern in the older years of reddit for a place for more discussion. For newer users it can come off as pretentious, but that's not its goal. This is a place for more discussion orientated topics that may not see as much attention in our near 2 million subscriber sister subreddit /r/Zelda. Think of TrueZelda as the /r/Games of /r/Gaming.\nYou can read more on its naming origins here.\nNeed more places to talk Zelda? Join our Discord: discord.gg/rzelda"}]}
