If you're not posting a build request, use a tag at the start of your post's title. Tags include [Meta], [Discussion], [Question], [Update]. Mobile app users may copy and paste the template from this page.\nIf you need a build in a less commonly requested country, include some places you can order from.\nMost building sites, like PCPartPicker and PC Hound, have retailer from most countries catalogued. They don't have all retailers in all countries though, so it's worthwhile to include some places you can order from if your country is not catalogued.\nAbsolutely no troll requests.\nThat means no \"I have no budget give me the best!\" requests. It also means if you're not planning on legitimately building it, don't post it. Remember, users volunteer their time and expertise here.\nIf your post goes 24 hours without receiving an adequate response, you may post your request again.\nThis can be if you didn't get any replies at all, or if you don't think you got the help you needed. Several posts in a shorter time scale is considered spam and may be removed.\nBe prepared to answer additional questions from contributors.\nTo get the best PC possible, contributors might ask extra questions. If you have any extra information you might be asked about, just include it in the \"Extra info or particulars\" part of the template before you post."},{"header":"Contributor Rules","description":"All builds must have some form of parts list, pricing, and an explanation or brief description of your suggestions.\nThis lets OP know why you've suggested what you have, and it lets others see your thought process & learn from it.\nWhen coming into a thread where others have already posted builds, look over existing suggestions before posting your own. This means you see any additional information that may have been provided by the OP, and also gives you a chance to give suggestions to other builders.\nCarefully read through provided criteria.\nIf you need more information, just ask the requester. It's better to ask than make an assumption.\nAim to keep below budget.\nIf you feel it's necessary to go over budget, make sure to justify it. It's also worth suggesting how your build can be pared back to be within the original budget if needed.\nCheck stock on items you include in a build.\nThis goes especially for sale items. You'll find sale items can be out of stock, meaning you'll have to find an alternative.\nNo advertising or payment for personal gain.\nThis includes all sale of hardware, software or labour, \"PM me for x\" posts and \"donations\" in return for advice or other goods. This is not a place for personal gain.\nAbsolutely no troll suggestions.\nIf you aren't willing to make a serious suggestion, don't make one. Stupid or sarcastic suggestions only confuse those needing help.\nTry to keep advice in the thread, rather than in private messages.\nUnless it's obvious that it's more appropriate, keep all discussion in the thread. It allows users (both those involved and not involved) to come back and reference it later, and use it as a learning tool."},{"header":"General Rules","description":"Keep discussion polite, civil, and on-topic.\nDisruption, rudeness and derailing are all grounds for your post to be removed. Report posters you believe are violating this by using the report function or messaging the moderators here.\nMessage the moderators if you have any questions, issues or queries. We're here to help!\nMessage the moderators if you see someone consistently posting builds with severe issues.\nSend a message here.\nDon't blindly downvote 'bad builds'. Reply with some ways the suggestions could be improved.\nThe only way to improve is if somebody tells you how and why your suggestions aren't great. Remember to reserve your downvotes for posts that are grossly misleading or flawed, or add no meaningful discussion to the thread.\nDiscussion of piracy and \"grey-market\" OS keys is forbidden.\nThis includes all promotion, discussion, suggestion, implication, insinuation etc. of piracy, so-called \"grey-market\" OS licence keys, and resold licenses. Such licenses may come from key-selling websites or other sites, including reddit. If it's unusually cheaper than retail, it's probably forbidden. If you're not sure, send a message to the moderators and ask. Posts breaking this rule will be removed and not reinstated.\nCircumvention of rules is strictly prohibited.\nSuch circumvention may result in a ban. This includes, but is not limited to, obfusticating information or offering private messages.\nPosts may be removed at the moderators' discretion.\nNothing is ever black-or-white, so if a post is clearly detrimental to the community, it will be removed."}]}
