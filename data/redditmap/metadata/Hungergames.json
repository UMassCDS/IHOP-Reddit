Participants start as either a Capitol or District citizen, and act as they would in the real Hunger Games â€“ sponsoring tributes and making bets, or participating in the Games, respectively. Games then happen multiple times a day at specified hours. Tributes' actions, skills and sponsorships determine the outcome, making the outcomes action-based, as opposed to random.\nIHGE Wiki Page\nIHGE Discord Server\nPanem Forever Minecraft Server\nPanem Forever is a feature-rich Minecraft server that includes regular Hunger Games events, architecture of Panem, storylines and quests.\nPF Website & Server Info\nPF Discord Server"}]}
