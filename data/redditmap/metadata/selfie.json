This is a scam, do not respond to people doing this.\nAlways double check who is actually a mod of the subreddit by referring to the mod list on the subreddit page. We will NEVER contact you via private chats or DMs from our own accounts requesting verification. If you get a legit verification request it will come from the mod mail and display as such or be an automated comment from automod.\nIf you get contacted by someone claiming to be a mod who is not please report them to both the mod team here and admins. The admins have greater powers to deal with such things but we can also ban them from the subreddit."}]}
