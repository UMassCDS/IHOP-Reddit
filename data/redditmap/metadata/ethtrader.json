The way it works is that on lower resolutions than the banner's the sides are cut off - so it's best to fill them with a uniform color or gradient. If you upload a banner with lower width than user's resolution (eg. the banner is 1920x192 but viewed on 2k or 4k), it's stretched while maintaining the aspect ratio, which progressively hides the bottom of the banner.\nYou can test how your banner is going to fit by creating a test subreddit and changing its banner.\nIf the banner buy/manage button is gone from reddit, you can still buy the banner using the DAO. Once you're the owner, message the mods with your chosen image.\nPlease contact the moderator team if you have any questions or problems."}]}
