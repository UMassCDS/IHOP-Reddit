Just make a post with the relevant information: languages you'd like to practice, languages you can help with, and the sorts of interaction you're interested in. Or you can just message people with compatible interests.\nPlease stick to the format \"Offering: . Seeking:\" / Seeking: . Offering.\". This is a rule, so not following it may result in your publication being removed or being banned (due to persistence)\nPlease select a post flair for your post that best matches the language(s) you're OFFERING. That way it is easy for others to easily find all users who are offering a language.\nYou MUST offer a language. No seeking without offering. You are welcome to help others teach your language without anything in return.\nExamples of posts that are allowed:\nOffering: English, Seeking: Vietnamese (and friendship!)\nOffering: Mandarin, Seeking: Japanese, Spanish\nOffering: Russian, Kazakh, Seeking: Nothing\nExamples of posts that are NOT allowed:\nOffering: Nothing, Seeking: Hindi\nOffering: Friendship, Seeking: French\nOffering: Bulgarian, Seeking: Friendship\n(The main purpose of this sub is language exchange and language learning! There are other subs for finding general friends.)\nThe goal here is not specifically to form paired relationships. If you know a language well and just want to speak or write it with others without wanting anything in return, you're more than welcome to offer.\nMostly, just use this as a place to find people to talk/write with in languages you're learning or languages you know well.\nIn order to improve your chances of finding fitting language partners, remember that you will be communicating with real people. So consider including some information about yourself, such as hobbies, age, gender, as well your timezone/time availability for real time communication."}]}
