It was a response to urbanization, and to the Industrial Revolution in Europe and the United States.\nClassical Liberalism generally doesn't include any socialist components (contrary to Social Liberalism) and so favors an individual's ability to distinguish themselves through hard work rather than substantial wealth redistribution. Classical Liberalism applies reasonable limits on liberty (contrary to Libertarianism) where pure individualism would be excessive for a properly functioning society."}]}
