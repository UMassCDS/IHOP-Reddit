This is a voice and text chatroom, with weekly open study and discussion groups. NOTE: The moderation team of the discord is distinct from the moderation team of this subreddit Thus, the /r/Occult mods have neither the authority nor the ability (and likely not the inclination) to unban you from the Discord Please don't ask.\nWiki\nThe /r/Occult wiki contains FAQs, educational resources, and more.\nGuidelines\nThis subreddit seeks to create an environment for the respectful debate and discussion of occult philosophy and metaphysics.\nReview the FAQ before posting. Specific questions are always welcome, but any post relating to these topics will be removed.\nAny posts pertaining to conspiracy theories, the NWO, the Illuminati, 9/11, or related topics will be removed. Try /r/Conspiracy or /r/OccultConspiracy.\nIf you want to post commercial links, links to your YouTube channels, and links to your Etsy store, we ask that you keep these to no more than 2x a month. We are trying to avoid the use of /r/Occult solely to promote goods or services. You must also post a comment explaining the work, what it symbolizes, etc. Commercial posts without a contributing comment from the author will be removed.\nThe primary purpose of /r/Occult is discussion. Posts that are just images with no other context or explanation for why you found it worth sharing, occult memes/comics are not welcome. Other subreddits exist for these purposes (/r/OccultArt, /r/OccultMemes). Please no Instagram links.\nBigotry, racism, homophobia, and all threats physical or other will not be tolerated. Follow the Golden Rule.\nCheck your Magus-itis at the door.\nSpamming and trolling of any variety will not be tolerated.\nPosting occult-related work/crafts is tolerated. However, accounts that solely or continuously self-promote are subject to bans. Again, please keep this to no more than twice a month. Consider other subs like /r/OccultArt or /r/OccultMemes for such posts.\nPosts and comments made from accounts with negative karma, or posts containing \"suspicious\" links, will be auto-removed. If your post is legitimate, please message the mods.\nPosts that violate these guidelines may be removed at admin/moderator discretion. Repeat offenders and trolls will be banned.\nIf there is a problem, please report the post or comment to the mods.\nFAQs\nHow to Do Magic\nIllustrated Beginners Guide to Chaos Magic\nOccultism 101: The Basics\nOccultism 101: Types of Occultism Pt. 1\nWhere Do I Start?\nLearn 2 Magick for free\nOfficial Anthem\nPentagram Sam\nRelated Subreddits\n/r/Altars\n/r/Alchemy\n/r/Alexandria\n/r/Animism\n/r/AskAstrologers\n/r/AskOccult\n/r/AstralArmy\n/r/Astrology\n/r/AstrologyMemes\n/r/BlackMagic\n/r/BOTA\n/r/ChaosMagicians\n/r/ChaosMagick\n/r/ChristianOccultism\n/r/ConsultTheTarot\n/r/Cyberdelinaut\n/r/DarkGnosis\n/r/DemonolatryPractices\n/r/Demons\n/r/DimensionalJumping\n/r/Discordian\n/r/Divination\n/r/DreamInterpretation\n/r/Dreams\n/r/Druidism\n/r/Echerdex\n/r/ElderWitches\n/r/Energy_Manipulation\n/r/Energy_Work\n/r/Enochian\n/r/Esoterica\n/r/EsotericChristianity\n/r/Esotericism\n/r/GameArcane\n/r/Geomancy\n/r/Gnostic\n/r/Gnosticism\n/r/GoldenDawnMagicians\n/r/Grimoires\n/r/Heathenry\n/r/HellsomeMemes\n/r/Herbalism\n/r/Herblore\n/r/Hermeticism\n/r/Hermetics\n/r/HolySummoners\n/r/IChing\n/r/JewishKabbalah\n/r/Jung\n/r/Kybalion\n/r/LeftHandPath\n/r/Magick\n/r/MagicUsers\n/r/Mediums\n/r/Mysticism\n/r/NeoPagan\n/r/Numerology\n/r/Occult_Art\n/r/OccultConspiracy\n/r/OccultCord\n/r/Occult_Music\n/r/OccultMemes\n/r/OccultPoetry\n/r/OccultTrade\n/r/Occult_R4R\n/r/PaganArt\n/r/PaganCraftExchange\n/r/PaganFestivals\n/r/Paganism\n/r/PaganMarketplace\n/r/PaganMemes\n/r/PaganMusic\n/r/PaganPenPals\n/r/PaganR4R\n/r/PaganStudies\n/r/Paranormal\n/r/ParanormalScience\n/r/PastLives\n/r/Precognition\n/r/Psychonaut\n/r/Psychic\n/r/Qabalah\n/r/Quareia\n/r/Randonauts\n/r/Reiki\n/r/Runecasting\n/r/Runes\n/r/SatanicArt\n/r/SatanicGaming\n/r/SatanicLiterature\n/r/Satanic_Memes\n/r/SatanicMusic\n/r/SatanicProse\n/r/SatanicTemple_Reddit\n/r/Satanism\n/r/Satanists\n/r/Setianism\n/r/Shamanism\n/r/Sigils\n/r/SolitaryWicca\n/r/SorceryOfTheSpectacle\n/r/Spiritual\n/r/Symbology\n/r/Tarot\n/r/Tarots\n/r/Technomancy\n/r/Telekinesis\n/r/Thelema\n/r/TheMysterySchool\n/r/TheoryOfAstrology\n/r/Theosophy\n/r/TraditionalWicca\n/r/Tulpas\n/r/Vodou\n/r/VRMysterySchool\n/r/Wicca\n/r/Witchcraft\n/r/Witch_House\n/r/Witchy_Things\n/r/Zodiac\n/r/ZodiacArt\n(If you'd like a subreddit added to the sidebar, feel free to message the mods here)"}]}
