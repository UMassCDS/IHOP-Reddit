We exchange information via PM only.\nNo texting and driving. Please consider the other motorists. It isn't just your life in your hands\nSearch via tags\nI'm male looking for a:\nFemale\nMale\nTransgender\nRedditor\nGroup\nI'm female looking for a:\nFemale\nMale\nTransgender\nRedditor\nGroup\nI'm transgender looking for a:\nFemale\nMale\nTransgender\nRedditor\nGroup\nI'm a redditor looking for a:\nFemale\nMale\nTransgender\nRedditor\nGroup\nWe're a group looking for a:\nFemale\nMale\nTransgender\nRedditor\nHow to verify:\nInclude the tag [Verification] in your title, along with a link to a selfie including your beautiful face and holding a sign (or written on your body) with your reddit username, the name of this subreddit and the date. If you're using a sign, crumple the paper then unfold. There will be a two-step verification for any pictures that do not pass processing.\nSubreddit Rules:\nDo not post your username or group hashtag in your post or comment. Do not hint at what it might be. We absolutely do not allow any information like that in public for safety reasons. There is no middle ground here, you must instruct users to PM you. Here is why\nWe are a judgement free zone: we ask users to keep comments positive. This isn't the place to oppress others with your morals. If you think a post is not appropriate, use the report button.\nSelling of services is absolutely prohibited here. Use the report button or modmail if you come across a seller; there are subreddits better suited for this kind of thing. Users are here for free hugs!\nEveryone is welcome to post once every twelve hours. Removing old posts or using alternate usernames does not exempt you from this rule.\nUsers will not post on behalf of others. Don't post pictures of others either. This is super catfishy and creepy.\nDon't message the OP if you don't fit their criteria: There are plenty of other fish in the sea.\nBe ready to chat now: Don't expect to post, go to sleep or take a flight and then come back later to a full inbox. This is pretty selfish tbh and your post will be removed.\nGroups: you too may post once every twelve hours and make sure other group users don't post within twelve hours of your post. Take care to ensure that your post isn't voted on by your users as this is considered to be vote manipulation. Your users are welcome and encouraged to comment though!\nHow to create a post:\nWhen creating a post you are required to use the proper tags or the AutoModerator will automatically remove it.\nThe title should start off with your age and then the proper tag, you can pick from those listed below\nM Stands for Male. F stands for Female. R stands for Redditor (meaning any gender or unspecified) and T stands for Trans. Tag Examples: 22 [F4M], [M4F], [G4F], [M4M], [T4F], [T4M], [M4G], [F4R], [T4R].\nYou can add something constructive after the gender tag. So your title should look something like \"20 [F4R] Outgoing young lady looking to talk to anyone.\"\nAllowed tags: [META], [F4R], [F4M], [F4F], [F4T], [F4G], [M4F], [M4M], [M4R], [M4T], [M4G], [R4F], [R4M], [R4R], [R4T], [R4G], [T4M], [T4F], [T4R], [T4T], [T4G], [G4M], [G4F], [G4R], [G4T]\nOther Great Subreddits:\nSkypepals\nDirtyKikpals\nGamerPals\nMeetNewPeopleHere\nRecordings\nFurryKikPals"}]}
