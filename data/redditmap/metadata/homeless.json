While many homeless might be addicts or mentally ill, there is still a significant population of homeless that does not fit within this stereotype. Many people are forced out of their homes after losing a job, receiving expensive medical care, refusing to stay in an abusive or toxic environment, or are pushed onto the streets by family or friends who cannot care for them any longer. These are very broad examples, and not every homeless person's story will be the same.\nHomelessness is a very serious issue and we think that it's time that Reddit united to combat this problem.\nThis subreddit needs people like you!
