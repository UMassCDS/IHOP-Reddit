It often targets people who use or rely on public space more than others, like people who are homeless and youth, by restricting the behaviours they engage in. Also known as defensive architecture, hostile design, unpleasant design, exclusionary design, or defensive urban design.","created":"Created May 16, 2016","stats":["136k Members","46 Online","Top 1% Ranked by Size"]},"other_information":[]}
