Can't get a head or hand back on after doing a swap? Blast the problem area with a hair dryer for about 10 seconds or hold the figure in hot water for a little while, this should soften it up so you can swap body parts and/or pose your figures without breaking them. This is especially important for old figures as plastic hardens over time!"}]}
