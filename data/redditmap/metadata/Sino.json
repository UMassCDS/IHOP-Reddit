Free speech lost to user restrictions. Free media lost to news bans. Free economy lost to gov. led. Free trade lost to trade restrictions. No matter the excuse for it, the value being tossed isn't China's. That's what really gets under their skin. That their values failed and they had to abandon them.\nCPC National Congress Reflection...of all the things anti China clowns hyped and then lost in the last few years\nJust a reminder US banned American citizens from Chinese semiconductor sector months ago then hyped some sort of collapse...and nothing happened ðŸ¤¡. Delusional narcissism isn't healthy.\nImagine being DPP and listening to \"internationally recognized\" every time anyone is discussing inside or about Ukraine...if it doesn't matter why is it constantly brought up by the very Ukrainians Westerners cheer for...awkward.\nNo matter what numbers westerners need to imagine to cope, it's not going to change the fact China opened up to weaker variants confirmed by WHO. Rehashing the exact same stories used early on in the pandemic 1 , 2. Only for everyone to admit in the end China had no mass death. Particularly from those who criticized lockdowns after failing theirs. The suffering certain countries experienced is sad, if coping with guesses can help go for it. Just don't expect anyone else to share in your imagination. It's been a month since re-open and there's no scale in China like those countries with most populous regions already passed peak infection. Even the made up numbers is still a paltry fraction due to the short time frame.\nlockdown protests or pro democracy belly flop\nBefore coming to talk about China's Covid policies, look up any stat on daily deaths of conflict in Ukraine, combine both sides even. Then compare with COVID-19 deaths are still averaging more than 2,000 per week | Weâ€™re still having between 300 and 400 deaths per day - Dr Fauci. For all of 2022. Now reflect, get some self awareness and turn back after realizing how stupid that would be.\nWith yet ANOTHER failure by the US at the UN on Xinjiang, sidebar no longer has enough room to document all their humiliation. Most recently Western initiative outnumbered 96 to 50 -> info moved over to our archive thread\n\"aMeRiCa StAnDs WiTh TaIwAn!\" -> then right after saying that America watched, from afar, as Taiwan literally got surrounded, blockaded and violated. Then had to stand there and listen to countries all over the world react to all this by restating they adhere to the One China Policy. Not praising US or supporting Taiwan.\nBorder Disputes with India https://archive.ph/akakd\nMessage the Moderators of r/Sino (bottom of sidebar) for info on discords and telegram.
