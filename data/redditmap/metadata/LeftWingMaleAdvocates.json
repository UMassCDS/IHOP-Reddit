A left-winger is someone who advocates reducing inequality through social change. This community aims to fill a void in the political landscape, by incorporating male issues into left-wing thought.\nWe believe men are not being well-served by either side of the mainstream political spectrum. We oppose right-wing exploitation of men's issues as a wedge to recruit men to inegalitarian traditional values. But we also oppose feminist attempts to deny male issues, or shoehorn them into a biased ideology that blames \"male privilege\" and guilt-trips men.\nWe have no objection to the genuinely egalitarian aspects of feminism, but we will criticize feminist ideology wherever it is inegalitarian and/or untruthful, especially now that it holds institutional power. Too often feminism has promoted a one-sided “equality”, dismantling male advantages while exploiting, reinforcing, preserving, and downplaying female advantages - particularly in cases involving alleged abuse.\nSee our Mission Statement for more details.\nFor details on our rules, see our Moderation Policy."},{"header":"r/LeftWingMaleAdvocates wiki","description":"We are gathering links to resources in our wiki"},{"header":"Male Positive Network","description":"A group of related subreddits:\n/r/BlackMaleAdvocates\n/r/CircumcisionGrief\n/r/Egalitarianism\n/r/everydaymisandry\n/r/Intactivism\n/r/Male_Studies\n/r/MalePsychology\n/r/Manly_Wisdom\n/r/mensupportmen\n/r/MRA_TitleIX"},{"header":"Other relevant subreddits","description":"/r/legaladvice\n/r/Menaregood\n/r/MenGetRapedToo\n/r/MensRights\n/r/MRRef"}]}
