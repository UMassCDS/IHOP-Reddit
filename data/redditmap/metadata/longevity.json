Just be sure to not post clickbait headlines, avoid hyperbolic headlines, and try to link to original sources.\nGeneral Subreddit Rules and FAQ.\nThis subreddit is not about solving problems that can be solved by diet (/r/ScientificNutrition), supplementation (/r/supplements), sleep, exercise (/r/fitness), or fasting (/r/fasting, /r/FMD). A good lifestyle helps increase the percentage of the healthy part of a life span, as well as reduces risk of early death or chronic sickness or disability, but does not help in defeating the inevitable age related disease.\nThere is nothing on the market as of right now (2022) that you can purchase or sign up for and get some of the benefits that are the aim of this subreddit (addressing multi-factors of age related damage and disease). The goals that are part of this subreddit's theme are being worked on in the form of very early research, and the expected time frame of such advances hitting the market are years away, but we are here to follow the progress.\nSubscribe if that interests you :)\nDiscord Links\nHealthspan\nLifespan.io\nVitaDAO\nProjects posted on r/longevity\nSENS Mitomouse - Funded\nMajor Mouse Testing Program - Funded, delayed pending review\nMouseAge - Funded, app developed\nAgeMeter - Funded, product developed\nOncoSENS, CellAge, NAD+ Mouse Project - Funded\nBlood Microbiome Crowdfunding Project - Cancelled due to Tuft Admin\nUsername flair\nMessage the moderators if you work in the industry/research and want to be recognised.\nLinks to external Longevity-related sites\nAgingBiotech.info\nLongevityList\nLongevity Wiki\nOutline of Life Extension on Wikipedia\nIndex of life extension related Wikipedia articles\nAccelerate cure for Alzheimers\nAging in Motion\nAging Matters\nAging Portfolio\nAlliance for Aging Research\nAlliance for Regenerative Medicine\nAmerican Academy of Anti-Aging Medicine\nAmerican Aging Association\nAmerican Federation for Aging Research\nAmerican Society on Aging\nBlue Zones - /r/BlueZones\nBrain Preservation Foundation\nBritish Society for Research on Aging\nCalico Labs\nCaloric Restriction Society\nChurch of Perpetual Life\nCoalition for Radical Life Extension\nCohbar\nDog Aging Project\nELPI Foundation for Indefinite Lifespan\nFight Aging!
