We encourage insults in the comments. The more ruthless, the better.\nTeeth do not count.\nSurgical procedures involving cutting/sawing bones (osteotomy) do not count either.\nA fracture does count, it is the same thing as a break.\nIt’s okay to break other people’s bones, in fact it is encouraged.
