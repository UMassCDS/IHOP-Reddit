Liberalism is the ideology of capitalism, free markets, representative democracy, legal rights and state monopoly on violence. It includes a large portion of the present day political spectrum, from the centre-left social democrats to the far-right conservatives and American libertarians. When it comes to liberals, we don't discriminate between tendencies â€“ we satirize all of them equally.","created":"Created Jul 24, 2012","stats":["179k Members","294 Online"]},"other_information":[]}
