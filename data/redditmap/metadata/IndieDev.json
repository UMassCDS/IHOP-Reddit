Links to Steam, Kickstarter or YouTube don't get anyone's attention. Check out our top posts of all time to get an idea\nKeep in mind that this is a community of developers and even though we're all gamers too, this isn't your audience per se, it's more like a room full of peers.\nWe have a community-run wiki with tips and tricks, related subreddits and helpful resources. There's a page to add your subreddit or website.\nThere are a lot of indie-dev-related communities on reddit, here's a full list, but the few in the sidebar/about-tab are a good place to start your reddit journey. They are friendly and active, but not overwhelmingly complicated.\nThat being said, there are no strict rules here, use common sense when you post and use that report button if you think you need to!\nIf you would like to do an AMA, add a game jam or any other event to the /r/IndieDev calendar, message the moderators!\nFor more information about submissions, you can check out the really detailed guidelines here.\nThanks!"}]}
