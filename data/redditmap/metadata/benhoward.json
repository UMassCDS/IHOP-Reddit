After having released 3 EP's and signing to Island Records, he recorded his folky sunlit debut album Every Kingdom (2011) resulting in 2 BRIT awards. The foreboding darkness of the electric Burgh Island EP (2012) also coated Ben’s second record I Forget Where We Were (2014). Its psychedelia-tinged follow-up, Noonday Dream (2018), awarded him with an Ivor Novello.\nHis latest album, Collections From The Whiteout (2021) features songs written from headlines scanned, or news stories scrolled past. Produced alongside Aaron Dessner (The National, Sharon Van Etten, Taylor Swift), Collections heralds the first time Ben has opened the door to production outside of him and his band’s closer confines.\n-In memory of u/bigsubwe."}]}
