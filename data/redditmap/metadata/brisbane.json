Where the river is brown and the traffic is tight and police will tase you if you're looking to fight.\nWhere George St holds the state's people of power and brothels are plentiful and charge by the hour. Where the dust settles for an Eastern coast rest and parking in the city is a hell of a test.\nWhere buses and bikes rule with a cold, iron fist and trains may as well not have a time-list. Where there's lockouts in clubs that cause more strain and hundreds of drunken louts stuck out in the rain.\nDespite all its flaws, the fact does remain it's an awesome city, and is far from being lame.\nBeautiful Brisbane, the capital city of Queensland. Please please please don't swim in the river.\nOff-topic trolling, derogatory remarks, and general unpleasantness will be removed. Please report any offensive comments."}]}
