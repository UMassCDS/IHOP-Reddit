Just click \"edit\" next to your name and choose the flag that best fits you.\nBefore you ask, read this \"Am I bi?\" FAQ!\nThe world isn't binary, and sexual orientation doesn't have to be, either. There is more than being straight or being gay. This group is for discussion and support for those who fall in between, for the \"shades of gay\" in what is often assumed to be one or the other:\nbisexuals\npansexuals\nomnisexuals\nqueers\nnon-straight individuals\n... or anyone who doesn't quite fit the otherwise binary \"straight\" and \"gay\" pattern. Whether sexual or asexual, everyone is welcome.\nSUBREDDIT BI-LAWS\nWe are not a strictly moderated subreddit but we ask that you are accepting of all people (particularly in your language) and treat everybody with respect. In particular, please keep the following rules in mind:\nBigotry (biphobia, homophobia, transphobia, racism, etc.) is not allowed. Acting in such a manner will result in a warning, temporary ban or permanent ban as the circumstances warrant.\nFor more information on transphobia / fetishization in this subreddit see this post\nErasing people's sexual orientations and/or gender identities (e.g. denying the existence of bisexuality, asexuality, pansexuality, or non-binary gender) is not allowed.\nNo \"Low Effort posts\" This includes selfie posts, bi colors posts, stereotype posts, and other trends. Selfie posts should be posted in /r/BisexualHumans. As \"low-effort\" is a very relative term, the mods will use our discretion to determine what is and is not low effort. For a longer explanation, please see the Post Types section in this post.\nWednesdays and Thursdays are reserved for discussion. This rule is not currently enforced but will be implemented in the future. On these days, no memes or jokes may be posted, only posts that foster meaningful discussion. This is to allow the post to remain an enjoyable place while also allowing for serious discussion to be heard. Discussion days follow UTC.\nAll links to other subs must be in ‚Äúno-participation‚Äù mode (i.e. must begin with np.reddit.com). All posts must be flaired to assist in post filtering.\nNude/pornographic and hook-up posts are not allowed anywhere on the sub. Those should be posted in /r/BiSexy (NSFW) or other subreddits appropriate for that type of content.\nMemes reposted within 1 month of the last time they were posted are subject to being removed.\nResearch posts must meet certain criteria:\nSurveys must be related to bisexuality or the LGBT community, and\nSurveys must be approved by an ethics board or similar body. Please post a link to the corresponding letter of approval.\nAll research not meeting this criteria must be submitted to the moderators for approval before being posted.\nBisexual Communities\n/r/BiBros\n/r/BisexualHumans - SFW\n/r/bi_irl\n/r/birates\n/r/disasterbisexuals\n/r/bisexualadults\n/r/BisexualTeens\n/r/pansexual\n/r/queer\n/r/biwomen\n/r/bipoly\n/r/marriedandbi\n/r/bi4bi\n/r/BisexualMen\n/r/biromantic\n/r/BiGoneMild - NSFW\n/r/BiGoneMedium - NSFW\n/r/bigonewild - NSFW\nLocation Based Bisexual Subs\n/r/bisexualUK\n/r/BiandfineinCarolina\n/r/DfwBisexuals\n/r/biplusga\n/r/BiATX\nLGBT Interest Groups\n/r/LGBTBooks\n/r/LGBTLibrary\n/r/LGBTNews\n/r/LGBTPolitics\n/r/LGBTQwrites\n/r/lgbTV\n/r/gaymusic\n/r/LGBTQArtCommunity\nLGBT Communities\n/r/lgbt\n/r/ainbow\n/r/actuallesbians\n/r/transgender\n/r/asktransgender\n/r/ask_transgender\n/r/queertransmen\n/r/genderqueer\n/r/dualgender\n/r/Polyamory\n/r/asexuality\n/r/demisexuality\n/r/questioning\n/r/MeetLGBT\n/r/LGBTAustralia\n/r/LGBTParenting\n/r/LGBTriangle\n/r/samesexparents\n/r/queerconlangers\n/r/QueerKikPals\n/r/omnisexual\nOther\nDoes your subreddit support /r/bisexual?
