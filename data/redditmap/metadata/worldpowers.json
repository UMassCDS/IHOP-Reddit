WP is intentionally unrealistic, focusing on internal consistency with events that happen in the game over real-world projections and likelihoods. This allows us to create a unique and bizarre future every season where any country could rise to preeminence or hegemony.","created":"Created Mar 15, 2014","stats":["7.8k Members","69 Online"]},"other_information":[]}
