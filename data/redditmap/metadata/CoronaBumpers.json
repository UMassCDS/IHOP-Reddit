In addition to Reddits site wide rules, we ask\nBe civil. This is a stressful time for everyone, so please be kind in the comments.\nNo medical advice.\nNo spamming, self promotion, trolling, etc. This is not a page for boosting your own blog or posting art pictures of yourself with a 3M mask (especially during a shortage, what are you doing?)\nNO DENIALISM. Some people want to be comforted but this is not a place to assuage peoples fears by telling them to chill and not worry. Do not assume peoples medical history to be optimistic. This is a place to discuss risks and safety precautions, people are right to have fear and concern.\nNo anti-vaxx or anti-science based advice. You are within your right to question policy in place at your local hospital, however this sub is not the place to rally people against hospital rules, regulations, or advice. In addition, no homeopathic advice in lieu of medical treatment or advice from a doctor.\nPlease be liberal with the report button if you find someone breaking the rules or generally making the atmosphere a bad one.\nVolunteers currently needed!\nWe are looking to create a long stickied post of pregnancy related studies and resources, even city specific. If you have compiled resources of this nature, please share so we can get that ball rolling as we are a baby sub trying to manage. Thank you all for your patience and contributions to the sub while we develop."}]}
