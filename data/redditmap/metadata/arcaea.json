This FAQ has you covered. It will be added to as time goes on.\nQ1: I've just installed the game and all the songs cost money! What gives?\nA1: The game starts in the \"Memory Archive\" pack. All the free songs are found in the Arcaea pack, just tap on \"Memory Archive\" and navigate to the Free pack.\nQ2: What is Past, Present and Future?\nA2: These are the difficulties in Arcaea, think of them as Easy, Medium & Hard. There is also another difficulty beyond these. Some songs will be harder, i.e a Future 10+ is harder than Future 9. If you are new, start at Past.\nQ3: What are Fragments?\nA3: Fragments is currency that you acquire as you play through the game, granted after every play or through World Mode. You can use fragments to unlock more songs in the free pack, among many of its uses.\nQuestion not answered? Maybe the community here can help!
