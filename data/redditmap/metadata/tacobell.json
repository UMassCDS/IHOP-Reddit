Wondering what E means when we say E5, E7?\nNo worries! Taco Bell has about 10-11 experiences a year generally lasting 4-6 weeks. Each experience is a new main item and sometimes there will be other changes as well in drinks, menu items, special deals, etc.\nOn this sub, the top pinned post will always explain the current experience. At the bottom of that megathread youâ€™ll find two links. One link will show you previous experience through the year and the other link will take you to expected/rumored experiences.\nIf you ever have any other questions feel free to message the mods.\nEMPLOYEES: Message the mods for employee flairs.\nEX-EMPLOYEES: Message the mods for an ex-employee flair\nMOBILE APP ISSUES?
