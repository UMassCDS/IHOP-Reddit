Please feel free to join the conversation, discuss experiences, or ask for help.\nAs an advice community, our goal is to be unbiased and clear with news and information pertaining to student loans. Mods will be vigilant in ensuring personal opinion doesn't cloud the facts. Please keep this philosophy in mind when participating and use the report function to point out violations.\nYou should never have to pay for help with your student loans, especially federal loans. Nobody can get you a better deal, or access to a benefit or program, than you can get yourself, for free, by working directly through your loan servicer.\nMost of our community has knowledge of the United States loan system. Questions from all around the world are welcome, but we suggest also asking in subreddits related to your school or nation/region if you don't get a prompt response here.\nUseful links:\nStudentAid.gov : Just about anything you'd want to know about the basics of financial aid, student loans, and financing options.\nFSA Dashboard : Your Federal Student Aid account (formerly called NSLDS) is the U.S. Department of Education's official database for student aid.

Federal Student Aid, a part of the U.S. Department of Education, is the largest provider of student financial aid in the nation.\nAnnual Credit Report.com : This site, mandated by the federal government, lets you pull your full credit reports from all three major bureaus for free, once a year.
