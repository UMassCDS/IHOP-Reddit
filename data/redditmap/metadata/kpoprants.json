See here for why. Additionally, no posts about the CCP or Korean politics impacting kpop. See here for why.\nFanfiction - whether it’s good, bad, you approve, you disapprove, etc. This is because it can lead to brigading/hate towards an identified person which violates Reddit’s TOS and our own rules.\nNo posts about Oli London. Racist, offensive, culturally appropriative people do not need more attention, no matter how much they thrive on hate.\nNo posts about NFTs/Crypto. As a sub, we are just not qualified for that discussion and it brings out the trolls/crypto shills from other subs.\nNo posts about Reddit Cares Resources, 'downvote ranting' or brigade accusations. They attract trolls and edgelords who just send more of them.\nGender debates - no 'double standards' girl groups vs boy groups posts or male fans vs female fans posts."}]}
