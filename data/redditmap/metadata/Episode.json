Kind of like choose-your-own adventure. You can learn more about it here.\nWhere can I write a story?\nHead on over to the Creator's Corner. There's a ton of resources to get you started.\nWhat are the art styles?\nHere's a picture that shows the difference between the three main art styles: Classic, Ink, and Limelight. Most current stories are either in Ink or Limelight. There's also another style called Spotlight that does not have full-body animations.\nHow do I get my story published?\nOnce your story has 3 episodes with at least 400 lines of dialogue in each, you can submit them for publication. Pocket Gems (the creator) will be looking at writers with unique plots, realistic dialogue, and interesting choices.\nHelp! I'm getting an error on my app!\nMake sure you have the newest version of the app installed.\nMake sure you have a strong internet connection.\nMake sure your script is error-free. If there is even one error, it will not load on your device."},{"header":"Credits","description":"Some icons used on this subreddit have been sourced on Icons8.com"}]}
