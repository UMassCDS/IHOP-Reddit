Mope, vent, cry, drunk-type or share your feelings, make hugot, post related poetry and prose, you name it. It's because there are times we don't really need one's advice, pity or lesson; we just need to release it, then we can go on with our lives.","created":"Created Oct 5, 2017","stats":["17.3k Members","30 Online"]},"other_information":[{"header":"Emotional Crisis Hotlines","description":"If you are experiencing emotional crisis and need immediate assistance, please contact:\nHopeline Philippines 0917-558-4673 (Globe) | 0918-873-4673 (Smart) | 02-8804-4673 (PLDT) | 2919 (toll-free for Globe and TM)\nNational Center for Mental Health 0917-899-8727 | 989-8728\nIn Touch Community Services 02-8893-7603 | 0917-800-1123 | 0922-893-8944"},{"header":"Psych / Counseling Support","description":"https://www.gmanetwork.com/news/lifestyle/healthandwellness/780655/5-free-counseling-and-psychiatric-consultation-services-that-are-just-a-call-away/story/\nhttps://philstarlife.com/self/156907-list-mental-health-care-facilities\nhttps://bridgestonetires.com.ph/list-of-organizations-offering-free-counseling-online/\nhttp://www.silakbo.ph/help/"},{"header":"Alternative PH Subreddits","description":"For discussions related to mental health, and where you can find psychologists/psychiatrist resources ‚û°Ô∏è r/MentalHealthPH\nFor relationship advice from fellow PH redditors ‚û°Ô∏è r/relationship_advicePH\nFor PH-specific and general vent out / unloading / shout out of wins and milestones ‚û°Ô∏è r/OffMyChestPH\nFor unsent letters ‚û°Ô∏è r/PinoyUnsentLetters\nFor casual discussions ‚û°Ô∏è r/CasualPH and the Random Discussion threads in r/Philippines\nFor career concerns and discussions ‚û°Ô∏è r/phcareers\nWhen you want to ask redditors a question ‚û°Ô∏è r/PHAskReddit"}]}
