There are plenty of things considered socially unacceptable or uncool, but some people are so confident in owning it that it becomes commendable. Reaching the peak of not giving a fuck and doing whatever makes them happy even as others make fun of them for it. Those are Chads, rather man or woman. We aim to celebrate those Chads and applaud them for doing what they enjoy. We should all be able to do that without judgment.","created":"Created Feb 4, 2020","stats":["277k Chadtopians","211 Currently Browsing"]},"other_information":[]}
