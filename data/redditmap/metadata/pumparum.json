This is to prevent shill accounts from scamming our traders.\nPlease read! Karma and Tips for trading safely!\nItems That Can and Cannot Be Traded In-Game\nEfficient Soul Trading Guide to Leveling Up\nPlease be advised: Do not drop more than 15 items at a time before they're picked up\nPlease be advised: There are storage caps for inventory items.\nHere's the summon rules, but you can summon any level by using a password.\nKeep in mind, you will not see someone's sign if you're not embered and you will only see white and orange summon signs in areas you haven't killed the boss yet.\nHow to title your posts\nYou MUST put a tag in your post indicating the platform. These tags are:\n[PC]\n[XB1]\n[PS4]\nIf you do not, you will be sent a nice message reminding you and your post will be removed.\nStandard posting format is as follows:\n[Platform][Highest Weapon] W: X item H: Y items\nEXAMPLE:\n[PS4][+10/+5] - W: Crystal Sage's Rapier H: Wolnir's Holy Sword\nLook At The Documents Below Before Trading\nHow Player Trade Works\nYou Can Summon Any Level With A Password\nPlease be respectful and honorable to your fellow traders. If we get reports of someone running a scam, we'll smack the ban hammer down. However, it must be verifiable they actually confirmed a trade with you. Please reply in the threads. Please confirm trade is to occur in threads. Never reply to personal messages, as then I cannot verify that this person engaged in trade with you. We have a two strike policy, but that doesn't mean you get one strike. Play nice. If you get a strike you will be notified.\nIn addition, if you would like to vouch for someone's reputation, I'm sure they'd be happy to receive karma for it. After a trade has gone down, reply to their latest comment on your/their thread with \"+karma\" to give them their share, and make sure they give you some in return!
