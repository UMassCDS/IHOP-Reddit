It's a spoiler.\nDon't link to content that infringes copyright (e.g. LSAT torrents).\nIf someone posts a question about admissions, please direct them to /r/lawschooladmissions\nDon't be ashamed of your score. Only a tiny minority scores 165+. And don't shame anyone for their score.\nPosting Questions: The LSAC takes copyright violations seriously, and might sue.\nIf you want to ask about a specific question, do not paste the question. That's a copyright violation.\nYou can definitely ask about specific questions: just cite the test number. e.g.\nTest 63, section 1, question 14 --> \"The one about ESP\"\nIt's a good idea to describe the question, and which part of it you found confusing. Just don't post it verbatim. Thanks!\nFAQ\nMy post isn't appearing\nIt's probably in the spam filter. Mod message and it'll get sorted.\nIf you're a new account, make some comments before submitting. /r/LSAT seems to attract a lot of totally new accounts, but Reddit will often auto-spam submissons from accounts with 1 karma.\nWhat can I talk about after I take an official LSAT administration on test day?\nNot much. You signed an agreement not to disclose anything from the test. See this post for a full statement from LSAC.\nNote: I'm referring to unreleased tests that have not been disclosed by LSAC. Mind you, in the digital LSAT era, no test is disclosed, so this applies to every test.\nNew To Reddit?\nCheck out the Reddit FAQ wiki."}]}
