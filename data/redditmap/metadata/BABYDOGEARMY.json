This is something we are looking to discontinue when our swap releases and have the swap be what generates the burns, while the tokens we have are given as rewards to those who stake\nthey are finding and testing the final bugs with it, the swap itself is done, but farming as a service is the final component, still being worked on. I made a video already a while back of the swap working just need to get Farming as a service complete or else a swap without token rewards for liquidity providers seems kinda dead and repeated\nentire swap is not 0% fees, only select pairs that we run promotions on or have partnerships with who provide liquidity. The fees are .30% total fee, .05% goes to buy back and burn of baby doge .05% goes to treasury, .2% goes to liquidity providers. Holders of baby doge token pay lower fees depending on how many they hold. This is subject to change. We can select individual pairs like BabyDoge/BNB and place 0% fees on that pair or Bitcoin/USDT, any pair we can set lower fees to.\nthe first game will be announced shortly. It appears to be fully done with the last part a third party quill audits auditing the smart contract, then we can go live with beta hopefully soon, first game we make will be used with baby doge coin and it will burn baby doge coins\nutilities we build will have burn features, we cannot promise how effective they are though as its based on volume/use of the utilities, hopefully people use them!"},{"header":"‚ö†Ô∏è Avoid The Dog Catcher ‚ö†Ô∏è","description":"‚ö†Ô∏è DON'T GET SCAMMED ‚ö†Ô∏è\nDUE DILLIGENCE IS REQUIRED\nhttps://community.trustwallet.com/t/how-to-protect-your-crypto-from-phishers/212889\n‚ö†Ô∏è Never give out your wallet Recovery Phrases / Keys /Passwords etc...
