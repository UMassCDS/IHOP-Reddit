High effort submissions are welcome and encouraged but not mandatory. However, this sub still has a theme. Post that are way off topic or that aren't in the spirit of the sub may be removed. Post will not be removed, however, if they are merely low effort. The voting system will handle those.\nQuestions about the history, technology, or tactics of WW2 should be directed to subs like /r/WarCollege or /r/AskHistorians, while links to \"Boo\" comments and posts should be directed to subs like /r/ShitWehraboosSay or /r/ShiteKaiserboosSay."}]}
