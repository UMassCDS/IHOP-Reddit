This means that they can be posted here, but the subreddit as an entity considers these as simply meme templates and are not trying to promote the creator or promote any of their ideas that you may think are offensive or hateful, regardless if they actually are or not.\nSo please do not report these memes with (\"get this shit out of here\" or \"The comic creator is a literal nazi\". Also stop reporting things with spam, when they're not spam. That irritates the hell out of me"},{"header":"How to flair","description":"Flairing is used to organize the content on subreddits. On this sub, you flair posts with the media the screenshot, drawing, etc is from or the media it's about.\nExamples:\nIf your post uses a popular meme format and is about the Marvel comics, you flair it with \"Marvel\".\nIf the meme has a Beast Wars screenshot, you flair it with \"Beast Wars\"\nYou use \"other\" for anything that is Transformers related that doesn't fit any category or for anything that uses an equal amount of multiple medias(e.g a meme with G1 and RID)\n\"Non TF\" is used for non Transformers Giant mech or robot memes. Just remember it must depict a robot or mech, as in you can't use a screenshot with some guy from the show, it has to have the robot or mech in the image.\nHere's a link on how to flair on Reddit Redesign: https://i.imgur.com/3PkvIsA.gifv"},{"header":"Please Note 2:","description":"r/Transformemes is not affiliated with any subs on the sidebar. All opinions from other subs may not be those of r/Transformemes. The opinions of the r/Transformemes moderators may not be those of r/Transformemes itself as an entity.\nGod, I hate Wheelie, he sucks so much. I'd punch him if he was real and I was made of metal like a Transformer. Just joking this sub and I have nothing against Wheelie, we are neutral towards all Transformers (I won't speak for other mods, but I presume it's the same opinion), except Energon Hot Shot.\nEnergon Hot Shot looks like he was scanning a car and then mid scan someone threw a blue box in the way and he scanned that also. I love Armada Hot Shot's design and the Cybertron design is cool too, but Energon looks like shit. WTF did they do to my boy Hot Shot. Prime Hot Shot looks better.\nAnd even though I hate that they made Armada Hot Shot a dumb kid in Rescue Bots Academy, I like him more than Energon Hot Shot. At least RescueBots Hot Shot makes sense cause his personality suits the context. But lets not forget these opinions are mine(u/geo126x) and not of the sub or other mods."}]}
