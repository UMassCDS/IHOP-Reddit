This is a story-based subreddit, and we enjoy reading long stories.\nWhat doesn't belong:\nYou passed somebody on the street, and they gave you a creepy look. We know, it was scary and you don't want to ever meet them again. But your post should go to /r/CreepyEncounters instead; LNM is set up to focus on creepy encounters that are out of the ordinary.\nThis didn't happen to you, but it happened to a close friend or a family member. This is actually a rule, but it happens often enough that it bears repeating. We're very concerned with truthfulness here on LNM -- not in the way that /r/nosleep is, but the actual events that happened, which means that the story needs to come from the person who experienced the events. And that leads into this next one:\nDon't exaggerate. If you need to exaggerate or embellish, your story should go to /r/CreepyEncounters instead.\nWhat does belong:\nYou were stalked. You legitimately had somebody following you around, and they weren't simply a drunk person who was lost. Or maybe you were followed over the course of a couple days, or months, or years.\nYou were kidnapped, or almost kidnapped.\nYou found something really creepy (for example, you stumbled on something similar to this).\nThe actions of the antagonist were outright bizarre; not merely harassment by a run-of-the-mill creep, but actions a normal (or even slightly abnormal) person in that situation would not have done."}]}
