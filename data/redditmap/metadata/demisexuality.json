A demisexual is a person who may experience sexual attraction but only after forming a strong emotional connection with someone. It's all a spectrum. Some demisexuals may feel very close to asexuality and experience attraction to extremely few people in their entire lifetimes, and each may take a very long time to develop, while others may find attraction develops more frequently and often find themselves crushing on their friends.","created":"Created Oct 22, 2010","stats":["79.3k Members","165 Online"]},"other_information":[]}
