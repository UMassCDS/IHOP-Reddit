Wade Remembrance Observance\nFeb. 15th: Lupercalia\nBased on the Roman festival of the same name, Lupercalia falls on February 15. In keeping with the ancient tradition, February 13th and 14th are observed as feast days leading up to the actual holiday. What we are translating this to in TST is a \"hail yourself\" day. This idea offers a parallel to the \"others-centered\" traditions of Sol Invictus.\nApril 30th: Hexennacht\nIn Johann Wolfgang von Goethe's Faust: a Tragedy (1808), Mephisto and Faust attend the Walpurgisnacht revelry atop Mount Brocken. TST's Hexenacht is a solemn holiday to honor those who were victimized by superstition.\nJune 6th: Devil's Night Observance\n666\nJuly 25th: Unveiling Day\nA centerpiece of our religious movement and icon of modern Satanism, the Baphomet with Children statue was commissioned by The Satanic Temple in 2014 and created by Mark Porter with \"respect for diversity and religious minorities\" in mind. On July 25, 2015, The Satanic Temple unveiled Baphomet to a large crowd of devotees in Detroit, signaling the beginning of the new Satanic era. We observe this milestone in Satanic history by celebrating Unveiling Day.\nSept. 30th: Blasphemy Day Observance\nOct. 31st: Halloween\nHalloween is consistently described as evil, demonic, and satanic by those steeped in religious dogma. Costumes, candy, and facing fears are to be embraced.\nDec. 25th: Sol Invictus\nThe cult of Sol existed within Rome since its early days as a republic, and Invictus was an epithet used for Jupiter, Mars, and Apollo (among others). The festival celebrated these gods and may have also been used to celebrate the winter solstice, though this is debatable."},{"header":"Satanist-Owned Businesses","description":"Pins, Oils, and Perfumes: Hexennacht\nSatanic Ritual, Writing, and Art: Serpentinae\nPBN Satanic Tea Company: Pitchblacknorth\nSatanic Clothes, Jewelry, and More: Ashemadeva\nLiterary-Themed Romantic Horror Bar in Buffalo, NY: TheMaryShelly"}]}
