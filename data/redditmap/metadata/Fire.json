It's not easy, but it is simple: earn more, spend less, and use the difference wisely. Build a baseline of financial security with the difference first, then use it to invest for your future. That way you can begin to earn financial freedom and control your own destiny.","created":"Created Apr 22, 2009","stats":["253k Savers Joined","216 Online"]},"other_information":[]}
