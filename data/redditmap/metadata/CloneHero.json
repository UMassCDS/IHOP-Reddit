Here you can post questions, videos and images etc.\nTo try and keep the subreddit less cluttered, please keep all requests for charts (either requesting a link to an existing chart or requesting a new chart be made) to the #chart-requests channel of the official Clone Hero Discord server (linked below). This also includes posts asking for charts that improve various skills, include full difficulty, full band, or other such things. Any posts requesting charts will be removed.\nPlease do not try and facilitate the selling and purchasing of Clone Hero-related items through either posts or DM's. Instead, rely on trusted platforms such as eBay or OfferUp.
