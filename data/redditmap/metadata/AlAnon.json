We believe alcoholism is a family illness and that changed attitudes can aid recovery.\nAl-Anon is not allied with any sect, denomination, political entity, organization, or institution; does not engage in any controversy; neither endorses nor opposes any cause.\nAl-Anon has but one purpose: to help families of alcoholics. We do this by practicing the Twelve Steps, by welcoming and giving comfort to families of alcoholics, and by giving understanding and encouragement to the alcoholic.\nPlease note that this is NOT an official Al-Anon community\nUseful Links\nAl-Anon Family Groups Homepage\nFor Newcomers to Al-Anon\nAl-Anon Meeting Locator\nAl-Anon Virtual Meetings\nAl-Anon Conference Approved Literature\nQuestions or Concerns?\nFor any inappropriate behavior or rule breaking, please use the report button—reports get our attention!\n  For any other questions or suggestions, please message the moderators.\n "}]}
