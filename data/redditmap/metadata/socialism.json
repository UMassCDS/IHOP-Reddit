It seeks to overcome oppression in a holistic manner without neglecting any particular axis so that it might be eliminated, and genuine social emancipation may be realized. We recognize that Socialism cannot be achieved while structural oppression continues and workers are divided."},{"header":"Educational Materials","description":"üí≠ Get started with Socialism!\nSocialist Starter Pack\nReform or Revolution\nSocialism FAQs\nSocialist Ideological Tendencies\nOrganizing Toolkit\nüìï Socialist Literature\n/r/Socialism's Suggested Readings\nMarx For Beginners\nProle.info\nStudent Guide to Marxism\nCapitalism must die! - Stephanie McMillian\nüìΩÔ∏è Audiovisual Resources\nIntroduction to Marxism with Richard Wolff\nSocialism for Beginners\nReading Marx's Capital with David Harvey\nCrisis of Capitalism\nKapitalism 101: Law of Value Series\nAnarchist Films Archive\nüî¥ Other Resources\nHuge list of Resources on Socialism & related fights, by u/bayarea415\nBlack Socialists of America's Resources Selection\nSocialist Organitzations in the US\nr/Socialism-hosted AMA series\nSidebar images, by u/-Ex-"}]}
