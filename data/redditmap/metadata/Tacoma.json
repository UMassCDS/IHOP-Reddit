Much like the city, this forum is a dusty old jewel of Puget Sound. Some here spend all day talking about how gritty it is, others simply think this is where trucks were invented but Tacoma is a beautiful city filled with art, food, music, nature and people. This subreddit is intended to be a reflection of such. Welcome! You'll Like Tacoma.","created":"Created Oct 12, 2009","stats":["99.9k Tacomans","125 Online","Top 1% Ranked by Size"]},"other_information":[]}
