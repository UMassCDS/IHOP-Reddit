Will I learn Latin?\nA: In > 90% cases, no - you won’t be able to read Latin, and the effects of being subjected to this approach can be long-lasting or even permanent.\nQ: What does it mean to read Latin?\nA: Reading the text and understanding it, perhaps after a few attempts, but without recourse to another language, like you presumably understand English.\nQ: How does one learn to do this?\nA: Language competence is a skill (knowledge-how), and as with any skill, is acquired through a lot of practice, known as Comprehensible Input. Extensive research has shown that factual knowlege (knowledge-that) plays little if any role in successful acquisition.\nQ: Why don’t they teach me this?\nA: A result of the way that Latin has been taught for at least the last 150 years is that teaching or even reading it is beyond many classicists' abilities. Yes, you read that right. Teaching in Latin requires a level of spoken fluency. Reading a lot requires much more time than most programs allow. Standardised tests don't test language proficiency, but must be prepared for. Thus teaching Latin is replaced by teaching about it, and reading it by what used to be the emergency crutch of decoding it. In short, you will need to rely on yourself.\nQ: Is there a course that teaches this?\nA: Luckily there is one - LLPSI, Lingua Latina Per Se Illustrata. Written specifically for autodidacts, it's the curriculum most in line with second language acquisition theory, and one of the most praised language courses not just for Latin, but for any language. Here's some of our recommendations on how to use it.\nQ: Don't I need to learn the grammar as well?\nA: Of course. LLPSI teaches you to think about Latin grammar in Latin, and uses only Latin to do it.\nQ: Still, how about combining it with Wheelock's?\nA: Possible but far from seamless due to differences in order and presentation. LLPSI: Latine Disco and A Companion to Familia Romana / Roma Aeterna are designed for this instead. There are better and free intro grammars, but they should be superfluous between LLPSI and a no-nonsense school grammar with succint English and many examples. Moreland & Fleischer seems to be the best of the worst options.\nQ: Where can I get assistance in studying or chat in Latin?\nA:\nIntro Post to the LLPSI Discord Server;\nThe General Latin Discord Server.\nQ: Is Duolingo good for Latin?\nA: It's a supplement for vocabulary and grammar practice. It can't serve as a self-contained language course. Be careful when generalising from its examples.\nQ: Is Google Translate good for Latin?\nA: It's been made much better recently than what it used to be and can be a useful tool, but it still lags behind the major European languages.\nQ: Are translations and bilinguals bad or cheating?\nA: No. On the contrary, they're the next best thing after same-language glosses and free you from the dictionary. But their utility hinges on your ability to see the meaning behind the words (metalinguistic awareness), and on a > 90% level of unaided comprehension.\nQ: More pro tips and fun discussions of language pedagogy?\nA: Ok.\nQ: Gib all your resource now ok.\nA: Ok."}]}
