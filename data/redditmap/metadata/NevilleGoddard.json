Neville Lancelot Goddard was a spiritual teacher and author from Barbados, widely regarded as one of the most influential New Thought and Law of Attraction teachers. He originally came to the United States to study drama, and became a dancer; but his study of metaphysics led him down a different path.\nNeville was different from other metaphysical teachers, in that he taught the Bible, but NOT as a book of history. He taught the Bible as an allegorical picture of the imaginal act.\nHe believed that human imagination is the only God and a person can achieve anything by imagining the wish fulfilled.\n  Neville's Brief Biography\n  New to Neville?\nBefore posting, we ask that you familiarize yourself with Neville's teachings.
