We strongly advise that you use League Safe, Fantrax Treasurer, Yahoo, or any other Fantasy Vault when joining a money league, especially if the league is run by a stranger.\nLeagues that refuse to use a Fantasy Vault are generally less safe. PayPal, Venmo, Zelle and/or your bank are not likely to refund your money if you send it directly to people.\nLeague Vaults are not 100% effective. It is possible, and relatively easy, to scam people even when using this service. Please always use caution when joining a money league.\nhttps://www.leaguesafe.com/ https://www.fantrax.com/"}]}
