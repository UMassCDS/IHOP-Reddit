Including literature theory, nitpicking, reviews no one asked for, and examining how the romance genre intersects with feminism!\nAnd also a place to post our sick memes.\nThe focus will be on \"romancelandia\" as a whole: books of course, author commentary, politics, news, movies, tv shows, reviews, book clubs/buddy reads, and more.\nWe also wanted a place where it is acknowledged that the romance genre is and has the potential to be a transformative space, where life-affirming things can happen for women, men, enbies, trans folks, and BIPOC. We wanted a place where women were in charge and anti-racism was an active part of the discussion."},{"header":"Weekly Post Schedule","description":"Daily: ðŸ’¬Romancelandia Readerâ€™s Chat\nWeekly:\nðŸ˜±WTF Wednesday- Share your WTF romance moments: the good, the bad, and the ugly\nðŸ’¯Fresh Faves Friday- share good book finds and passages\nðŸ’©Shitpost Saturdays- \"discussion-based\" rule is loosened for all posts\nMonthly: ðŸ“šReading Recap- First Tuesdays"}]}
