Anarchists advocate a self-managed, classless, stateless society without borders, bosses, or rulers where everyone takes collective responsibility for the health and prosperity of themselves and the environment.","created":"Created Jan 25, 2008","stats":["256k Members","298 Online"]},"other_information":[{"header":"Sidebar","description":"Free Palestine!\nFeatured Sub: /r/auntienetwork\nACAB?
