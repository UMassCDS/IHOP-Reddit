What is Hobby Drama?\nFor the purposes of our subreddit, a hobby community is \"a group of people who are connected by their active participation in a particular activity during their free time for personal enjoyment\".\nExamples of hobbies include: cosplay, model rocketry, fanfiction, blogging, historical reenactment, gaming, fanart, participating in forums, gardening, cooking, playing sports, composing music, making memes, collecting, backpacking, knitting, reading, and many, many more.\nHobby Drama is an event which happened in a hobby that created meaningful controversy within the community involved. Hobby Drama-worthy events might have ousted someone from the community, shaped perception of the hobby, altered the rules the hobby uses, divided the community, created a new faction, caused significant outrage, etc. They are not blink-and-you'll-miss-it catfights with no consequences or internet influencers being rude to each other.\nWhat is not a hobby? What is NOT Hobby Drama?\nMost drama between professionals is not hobby drama, e.g. professional sports teams, YouTubers, streamers, actors, scientists, etc., unless the professionals are interacting with hobbyists/fans. Current events, news, real-world politics, following a social media account, and being internet famous do not qualify as hobbies. Mods reserve the right to make exceptions for particularly bizarre or niche write-ups.\nDrama must have active involvement by hobbyists to qualify as hobby drama. It cannot be a contained event between professionals where hobbyists had no involvement or no impact on the perception of the occurrence. A TV show finale being bad isn't hobby drama; the fandom reaction leading to it being called 'the worst TV finale ever' might be.\nWhat is a hobby drama post?\nA high-quality, well thought-out post about a dramatic event in a hobby space. Readers overwhelmingly prefer posts which lay out the history, stakes, events, and consequences of the drama, and which include receipts like screenshots or chat logs. Posts should have minimal direct involvement by the poster and not be overwhelmingly biased, and any personal information of participants who are not public figures must be censored.\nWhat is NOT a Hobby Drama post?\nA short paragraph, one liner, a post directly asking for advice or a post that is fabricated or fictional. Please see the wiki for more information.\nA Note on Hobby History\nFor posters who want to infodump about the history of their favorite hobby or a particularly interesting moment in it, we allow Hobby History posts. Hobby History posts do not need to be dramatic. Since they're meant to be historical, they can focus entirely on professionals in a space. They can explain the background events leading up to a dramatic event, or explain the minutiae of how a hobby works; recount a legend of the hobby thatâ€™s not quite drama, or just give context on how this hobbyist community works.\nA note on Flair\nIf a post discusses subjects that might be shocking, unpleasant or distressing to readers, it must be flaired Heavy. The NSFW tag should also be used when appropriate. Otherwise, if a post is a Hobby History, it should use one of the blue History length flairs, and if not, one of the red length flairs. The maximum length of a post is 40 000 characters, so an Extra Long post might be more than 25 000 characters, a Long post might be over 15 000, and so on. You can see more information about flairs on the wiki."},{"header":"Credit","description":"P.S.
