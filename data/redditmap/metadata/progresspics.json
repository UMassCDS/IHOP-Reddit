This is the reddit to post those awesome before/after pictures of yours!\nPosting Rules and Guidelines:\nUse this format when posting pictures to help everyone understand the transformation and journey you have been on:\nGender/Age/Height [Weight Before > Weight After = Total Amount Lost] (Time period in months) Personal title\n(Example: F/23/5'5\" [189lbs > 169lbs = 20lbs] (4 months) Been lurking for a while)\nLink only to a progresspic image or a collection of progresspic images. This requires a before and an after of a human. We do not accept pictures of graphs, or other inanimate objects such as belts. Exception: The top stickied post may be used for appropriate subreddit posts/discussion.\nThere should be a clear before and after picture that is posted. It does not need to display weight loss. Progress can come in many different forms. If you have any questions as to whether your submission fits into /r/progresspics, feel free to send a message in mod mail.\nDo not link your entire social-media profile.\nAll pictures must be original content and posted with the consent of the subject. Reposts or images found elsewhere on the Internet will be removed. If you see content that has been posted elsewhere before, please message the moderators with a link to the original.\nBe good to one another. If critiquing, only do so constructively. Be polite. Practice Reddiquette. Don't be a pervert.\nStay on topic to the original post, the pictures, or the original poster's comments.\nDo not bring political topics or discussion into /r/progresspics.\nReport problems. Use the report link. Feeding trolls just attracts trolls.\nDo not harass other users through Reddit's private messaging system. Yes, this includes sending unsolicited nude photos of yourself. If you have been sent creepy or disturbing messages after posting on /r/progresspics, please send a screenshot of their message to modmail, report their message to the Reddit admins, and block them.\nUsers under 18 are permitted to post, but they must be fully clothed. Absolutely no exceptions. This applies even if you're 18 or older, and your before picture features a less than fully clothed under-aged you.\nBe polite, follow the rules. Mark posts NSFW when appropriate.\nRelated subreddits:\nr/loseit - Lose fat\nr/fitness - Gain strength\nr/xxfitness - Fit women\nr/gainit - lean weight\nr/1200isplenty - small bodies\nr/1200isplentyketo - Low-cal keto\nr/vegan1200isplenty - Low-cal plant based diet\nr/keto - keto\nr/eatcheapandhealthy - low cost\nr/mealprepsunday - Meal Prep\nr/intermittentfasting - healthy Fasting\nr/Myfitnesspal - MFP\nr/bodyweightfitness - no gym\nr/HIIT - High intensity interval training\n "}]}
