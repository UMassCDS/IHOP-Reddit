Artists may offer to do freebies for practice if they choose, but that is their decision to make. Request posts will be deleted. On a similar note- commission offers are more appropriate for /r/furry_catwalk\nIf you post an image that you have created, people will critique and complement you on it.\nDownvotes are to mark spam and unhelpful posts. If you don't like a piece either ignore it or offer CC. Discouraging beginners is not helpful. Comments that are rude without offering useful criticism will be removed.\nIf you do not want criticism, you're better off posting in any other showcase subreddit -- this is for people who want to improve and grow in their skill, not to pad their ego.\nAlso, if the image is NSFW, please flag it as such.\nThank you, and enjoy your stay!\nUseful Links\nDiscord Server\nTutorial Posts Only"}]}
