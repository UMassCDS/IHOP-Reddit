It is no longer possible to obtain the old (long-form) health reports with a new kit regardless of what country you live in.\nFor individuals who have purchased the US-specific/international \"Ancestry\" test on or after September 21, 2016, you must pay a $125 upgrade fee to have access to the new (FDA approved) health reports.\nIn all other cases, please see https://www.reddit.com/r/23andme/wiki/reports for more information."},{"header":"Data Analysis","description":"If you're interested in getting even more ancestry-related info out of your data,\nGEDMatch is probably the most popular 3rd party ancestral calculator. It specifies in more ancient populations and admixture, with a wide variety of calculators to choose from.\nDNALand is another handy 3rd party tool which specifies in more regional and ancient admixture, with a relatively simpler approach for some users, compared to GEDMatch.\nIf you're interested in getting more health-related info out of your data,\nPromethease is a tool that may be of interest. Promethease is by far the best third-party data analysis tool, but there are many others out there to choose from.\ncodegen.eu is a decent free alternative to Promethease that gives you much of the same information.\nThere are many other options out there for data analysis, both paid and free."},{"header":"Disclaimers","description":"The members of this subreddit do not act as medical professionals.
