Inspired by cartoons of the 1930's, the visuals and audio were painstakingly created with the same techniques of the era, i.e. traditional cel animation (hand drawn & hand inked!), watercolor backgrounds and live jazz recordings.","created":"Created Jun 9, 2014","stats":["99.8k Members","56 Online","Top 1% Ranked by Size"]},"other_information":[]}
