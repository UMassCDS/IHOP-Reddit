We use the terms \"narcissist\" and \"narcissistic\" loosely to refer to a variety of conditions and abusive behaviors, and not in a clinical sense. It does not necessarily mean a diagnosis of narcissistic personality disorder. We are not professionals and cannot diagnose anybody.\nWhat is a narcissist?\nRead about traits and tactics that narcissists use. While they are titled traits specific to mothers, fathers can have these same traits.\nIf you suspect you may be a narcissist: read Help! I Think I am a Narcissist!\nIf you know you are a narcissist, if you identify as a narcissist, sociopath or psychopath or have a diagnosis of NPD or ASPD, consider posting to /r/selfimprovement or /r/DecidingToBeBetter as you will NOT be allowed to post or comment in this subreddit."},{"header":"Additional Info","description":"Moderation in this group is always biased FOR the OP (the person who made the post - not the commenters).\nFor example, if an OP does not appreciate comments of a religious nature, the moderators will defend the OP's boundaries. If an OP prefers comments of a religious nature, the moderators will also defend that boundary. This is a support group - we are all here to support the OP. Commenters sometimes feel that any comment should be allowed because this is a support group. But, we are biased FOR the OP's needs and boundaries. When you write your own post asking for support, we will also be biased for you.\nPlease keep in mind that the mods here are unpaid volunteers with their own busy lives and jobs and struggles.\nWe are not online 24/7. We cannot read every post or comment. We are not omnipotent.
