Be kind to each other.\nVictim blaming is jerk behavior.\n6 - No Racism/Hate Speech\nIf your submission does not appear in the new tab, and you don't think that it counts as spam - then it may have been caught by the spam filter. Message the moderators, and we will free it for you (assuming it is not actually spam.)\nSelf Promotion - The community has spoken: If you only submit links to your own content, your links will be removed as spam. We suggest being an active member of reddit before submitting links to your own site.\nPictures of your stuff – These can be somewhat controversial. They will be actively removed, unless there is some kind of necessary discussion involved.\nMemes – These will be actively removed, but consider posting in /r/fffffffuuuuuuuuuuuu, /r/AdviceAnimals, or /r/memes.\nSurveys – No surveys unless you're an active community member of /r/cycling. Surveys from new accounts will be removed.\nDon't be a jerk. Be kind to each other. - Don't attack people. If you can't say it nicely then perhaps don't say it at all. It isn't your job to \"fix\" random people on the internet. If someone insults you then move on or report them: Do not respond in kind.\nNo Racism/Hate Speech - There will be zero tolerance for racism, homophobia/transphobia, or sexism/misogyny, engaging in any sort of hate speech will result in the post or comment being removed and the poster being banned. We do not allow hate speech.\nNo Victim Blaming - Unless there is compelling evidence that a victim directly caused the accident there will be no speculation as to how they might have done so. The onus is always on the least vulnerable to protect the most vulnerable. If in fact someone dies as a direct result of their action we will respect rule 5 and make it a kind teachable moment.\nPlease keep discussions civil and respectful.
