This sub-reddit is for foreigners living in Bangkok first and foremost as well as any Bangkok related content. It was setup like this over 14 years ago when there was no other place for foreigners to discuss living here that was not toxic. There is now a large Thai speaking community at /r/thaithai if you would prefer more Thai language related content. I hope you enjoy the sub and please remember to talk to people nicely and try to be there for each other.","created":"Created Jul 30, 2008","stats":["48.4k Members","270 Online"]},"other_information":[{"header":"Links","description":"News\nBangkok Post\nThe Nation\nAsean Now's News Forum\nVisa & Work Permit Information\nImmigration's Site\nTourist\nNon-Immigrant\nWork Permit\nMisc\nAir Quality Index Twitter\nTravel Advice\nAirport Rail link times\nFuture BTS stations PDF Warning\nWiki Travel\nNightclubs"}]}
