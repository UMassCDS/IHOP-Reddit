Handled with much thought and attention, the relationship between Shinji and Asuka was one of the most prominent tools in the story that reflected the nature of human connections and relationships. A place of theory, discussion, images, and also anything shipping related. Especially shipping. Leave the negativity somewhere else and of course, no bullying!
