We recommend keeping an OPEN MIND. Astral Projection (OBEs) is the direct experience of transferring awareness to NON-PHYSICAL realities in order to explore BEYOND the physical. Our focus is on the spiritual practice of Astral Projection, studies and discussions on non-local states of consciousness, and understanding Out-of-Body phenomena. This is a science AND an art. This space is NOT for debates, jokes, fiction, or creative writing.","created":"Created Jul 24, 2010","stats":["278k Members","148 Online","Top 1% Ranked by Size"]},"other_information":[]}
