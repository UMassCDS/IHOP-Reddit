It can be quite cruel to Toastees to offer suggestions or improvements when they're putting themselves out there as they are!\nComplimenting is an interesting science. As when crafting insults, it is important to reach past the superficial levels of a person's personality, and to touch (and, in this case, praise) a deeper aspect of their character that somehow shines through.\nThough not all compliments have to be profound and penetrating, the simple expression of enjoyment of one's appearance and personality can often reach deeper than the most exacting descriptions.\nSo come on, everybody - we're awesome human beings! It's about time someone told us."},{"header":"In a Crisis?","description":"This sub and it's moderators are not equipped to handle mental health crises and suicidal ideations.
