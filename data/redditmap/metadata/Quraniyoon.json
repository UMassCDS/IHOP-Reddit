Only the Qur'an, the Islamic holy book, is accepted as divinely revealed and protected as Allah (the God)'s Word. We are not a monolithic group. Individual interpretations can vary.\nIt should be noted that we don't all like the \"Quranist\" title, and some of us reject it completely. However, this sub is named as such so that it would be easier for others to find and join our Reddit community."},{"header":"Community Aspirations","description":"The goal of this subreddit is to promote respectful and engaging discussion about Qur'an-only or Qur'an-oriented (rejection of some hadith) beliefs."},{"header":"Discussion Guidelines","description":"It is acknowledged that the beliefs expressed in this subreddit are highly controversial, and that one individual's understanding may be vastly different from another.
