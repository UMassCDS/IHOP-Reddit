It is not (primarily) a tech-support forum.\nTech-support requests should be readable by and useful to others. Include relevant details like logs, terminal output, system information. What exactly did you do, and how, and with what version of what? How have you tried to troubleshoot the problem? Vague, low-effort tech-support requests may get removed. This wiki page can help you gather system information.\nYou can now flair your own posts. Please mark your \"standalone\" tech-support requests as tech support and re-flair them as answered! if an answer has been found (even if it was \"can't be done\").\nRespect other users. Heated discussions are fine, unwarranted insults are not. Remember you are talking to another human being.\nDevs and content producers. If you've ported your game to Linux or created some GNU/Linux gaming related content (reviews, videos, articles) then, so long as you're willing to engage with the community, please post it here. If it's a link post, think about writing a comment to tell us more - the more you engage with us, the more we like it. We all need to support each other to help GNU/Linux gaming grow.\nSpam will be deleted. This means things like repetitious posting of similar content, low-effort posts/memes and misleading/exaggerated titles on link posts.
