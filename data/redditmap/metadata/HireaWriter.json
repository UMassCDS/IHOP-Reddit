Editing/translating jobs are accepted here.\nMinimum rate is 5 cents/word for ENTRY level work, 10 cents/word for GENERAL work, 15+ cents/word for ADVANCED work. Job offers or hire me posts using a misleading rate would be removed.\nConstantly updated blacklist of non-paying employers\nRead this if you are a new writer!\nQUICK CHECKLIST TO MAKE SURE YOU FOLLOW THE BASICS\nMention a payrate (preferably in $, i.e. $50)\nMake sure its at or above $0.05 per word for basic/entry level work. For general work its $0.10 per word. For advanced/niche work its $0.15+ per word.\nUse the proper flair.\nExceed 200 characters in your post\nHave at least some karma and age on your account (Hiring/META posts exempted)\nFor writers, make sure you LINK an online portfolio on your Hire Me post, if you dont have one, use the weekly stickied Writers thread. You can use free services like Journo Portfolio, Wordpress, Contently.net, Clippings.me, Pressfolios etc. Just note that we are not associated with any of them, and you use them at your own volition. If you are under legal obligations i.e. ghost writers, message the mods prior to posting.\nWriters are encouraged to use the \"Writer\" flair. They can earn a special \"Verified Writer\" flair. To earn it you need to complete at least one job and your employer has to contact the mods with the following: a short review of how they are satisfied with your work, your username, and a link to the original \"hire me\"/\"hiring\" post.\nGood luck!\nFeel free to message the mods, if you have any questions/concerns/advice on improving the subreddit. We usually try to respond within 24 hours at the latest."},{"header":"Other Great Subreddits:","description":"/r/HireanAcademicWriter - Our sister subreddit for academic related posts\n/r/GrowthHacking/\n/r/writers4hire\n/r/FanFictionHire\n/r/RealDialogue\n/r/RisingAuthors\n/r/Screenwriting/\n/r/selfpublish/\n/r/WritingPrompts\n/r/KeepWriting\n/r/shortstories\n/r/promptoftheday\n/r/AmateurWriting/\n/r/Writeresearch\n/r/forhire/\n/r/WritersChoice/\n/r/writersforhire\n/r/writingopportunities\n/r/writing_gigs\n/r/homeworkhub\n/r/WriteATale/\n/r/beermoney\n/r/CongratsLikeImFive/"}]}
