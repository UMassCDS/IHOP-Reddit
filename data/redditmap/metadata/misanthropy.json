It is based on the flaws of mankind and can be expressed through emotions or judgments. It can be directed at all humans or exclude a few idealized people. Misanthropy can take on many forms, from destructive to constructive, and can range from actively trying to hurt or improve humanity, or to simply resigning from society and mocking the absurdity of the human condition.","created":"Created Feb 21, 2009","stats":["87.5k individuals","41 observing"]},"other_information":[{"header":"Welcome","description":"This is a place to understand and come to terms with your misanthropy, and turn it into a force for good.\nView detailed rules, policies, bot usage, etc.\nYou are encouraged to report transgressions."},{"header":"RELATED","description":"RELATED:\n/r/morbidreality - see the awful\n/r/antinatalism - anti-procreation\n/r/nihilism - there is nothing\n/r/iamatotalpieceofshit - undeniable facts\n/r/effectivealtruism - how to best do good\nGot suggestions?
