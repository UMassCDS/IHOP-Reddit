If you canâ€™t find an actual official date, an official release date had not been released yet\nQ: Why did they change the ninjaâ€™s design?\nA: The likely reason why the characterâ€™s design has changed is to try and give the character more unique and identifiable appearances, and to make the characters in the showâ€™s appearance more closely related to the movieâ€™s appearance.\nQ: Why is Season 11+ under a new show \"Ninjago\" instead of \"Ninjago: Masters of Spinjitzu\"?\nA: Secrets of Forbidden Spinjitzu and the following seasons are produced by WildBrain Ltd. This is a separate show from \"Ninjago: Masters of Spinjitzu\", which was produced by Wil Film Aps.\n\"Ninjago\" continues the story of \"Ninjago: Masters of Spinjitzu\" directly, just produced by different people.\nQ: Why is Prime Empire (Season 12) and Master of the Mountain (Season 13) listed as \"Season 2\" of \"Ninjago\" on Netflix?\nA: The creators made it like that because streaming and television services prefer to buy larger seasons.
