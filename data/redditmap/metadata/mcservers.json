There is some leeway so that you may post at a consistent time of day (eg. around noon on Sundays), but abuse will not be tolerated. Do not delete your posts in order to evade this rule.\nYou must be the owner of the server, or have explicit permission from them in order to create a post on behalf of the server.\nPosting servers to grief or harass is strictly forbidden and will lead to a ban.\nWhile acceptable to ask players to show support on your ads, consider reddit's site-wide rules on vote manipulation before doing so. Any evidence of vote manipulation will earn a ban.\nSlanderous, derogatory, or “troll” comments are forbidden. Writing a mature and respectful opinion of a server is highly encouraged. Flaming and personal attacks will be removed.\nDo not \"hijack\" posts to mention or advertise your own server."}]}
