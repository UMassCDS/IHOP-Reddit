This is a subreddit for the crypto coin called 'Corgi Inu' (CORGI).\nOFFICIAL WEBSITE\nhttps://corgiinu.com/\nJOIN TELEGRAM\nhttps://t.me/corgi_inu_token\nFOLLOW OUR TWITTER\nhttps://twitter.com/CorgiinuToken\nLive Price Chart and Trading History\nhttps://www.dextools.io/app/uniswap/pair-explorer/0xd563809827023e5b1160b554b86fe47f50cf9c44\nHow to buy CORGI\nStep 1\nGo to Uniswap https://app.uniswap.org/ and connect your wallet to it. It can be coinbase wallet, trustwallet or metamask.\nStep 2\nSince CORGI is a very new coin and hasn't been listed on coingecko or coinmarketcap, it won't show up by default when you search for it. In order to buy or sell the coin, you have to type in the token address in the search bar.\nToken address: 0xe50006781f435ae43096288334afd9ae5ba50065\nThis is the token address taken from the Corgi Inu website. https://corgiinu.com/\nStep 3\nYou should now be able to see CORGI and in order to buy it, you need to use ETH. Make sure that you have enough ETH for gas fees. It varies depending on the time of the day and the amount of people using the ETH network. The price can vary from $15 up to $45. (On days with heavy traffic it can potentially reach $100-$200)\nSince the coin has a low market cap, the price will be fluctuating a lot. When people sell or buy, the value of CORGI might go up and down by 1-10%. In order to avoid any issues when buying CORGI, you'll need to click on the gear icon. Click on the icon and set your slippage to 5% or 10%. That if the price changes while your transaction is pending, the transaction won't get canceled. You won't have to pay for any extra gas fees, by trying to buy/sell it again.\nUniswap is also migrating to a newer version called V3. If it says that there's an error when trying to buy or sell the coin and that there's a liquidity issue. Try clicking on the small text where it says swap to V2 or V3, depending on which one you're on."}]}
