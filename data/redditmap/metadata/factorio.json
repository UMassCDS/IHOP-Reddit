You won't be mining by hand for long, with the industrial revolution just a science lab away. Play alone, or start a multiplayer game with friends. Defend your factory from the local inhabitants, mine ores, refine oil, and burn forests to the ground; all in the name of progress.\nUpcoming Sales\nFactorio has never in many years had a sale, is currently not on sale, and is not expected to ever be on sale.\nkovarex: \"Not having a sale ever is part of our philosophy.\"\nCurrent prices: $35, 32â‚¬ (Other currencies)\nThere is a demo available if you are unsure about the game."},{"header":"Words of wisdom by /u/talrich","description":"Namaste. You seek balance. Here is my wisdom. Your mistakes have no cost but time, and the deconstruction planner even reduces that cost. Most games punish you for building, demolishing and rebuilding. Not Factorio. Let your anxiety wash away as you perceive that every belt placed can be moved. Every assembler is but a visitor to where it resides. The only significance is life, which leads to the further wisdom. Look both ways before you cross the tracks."}]}
