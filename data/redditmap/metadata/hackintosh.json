Do note we're primarily an intel subreddit but feel free to ask questions relating to AMD based systems. (AMD Laptops and AMD integrated GPUs are unsupported)\nYou can find the AMD OS X discord here\nOpenCore Install Guide\nmacOS INSTALLERS NOTE: This sub is dedicated to legally obtained copies of macOS. Please do not ask, or post, about things like iAtkos, Niresh, Olarila or any other modified macOS installer that may be compromised!\nPre-Built EFI NOTE: We provide minimal to no support for Pre-Built EFIs from GitHub, Hackintosher and such due to generally being heavily outdated, poorly made and users not knowing what their hackintoshes are doing. You may still ask for help but please be prepared to remake your EFI from scratch following the Vanilla Guide\nUniBeast and Multibeast NOTE: Unfortunately we do not support the use of beast tools due to being closed sourced, can modify macOS files and users largely not know what these tools are doing(more info here). You will be requested to restart your installation following the Vanilla guide to properly learn hackintoshing or face public humiliation and be stuck with your broken Hackintosh\nCheck out the brand-new FAQ! Don't ask before you read it fully, twice.\nMake sure you post your Hackintosh's specifications when you ask questions. (Posting guidelines in the FAQ or further down the sidebar)\nRegarding info/guides posted to this subreddit, we reserve all right to remove posts we feel either break the rules, provide poor info or redirects to other poorly made guides.
