We pride ourselves on being a friendly, inclusive place, where patients and loved ones alike can discuss thoughts and concerns, ask questions, and share information.

This tissue builds up and responds to the hormones produced by the body and it often results in pain and other symptoms. For a more in-depth description of endometriosis (or \"endo\"), please check out this article by the Center for Endometriosis Care.\nWe believe current research tells us that expert excision of lesions is the gold standard treatment for endometriosis and this often includes the use of hormones post surgery (though not always) - however, we also believe in supporting each other wherever we are on the journey to pain-free living and through whatever choices we make.\nNo one's disease is exactly the same, neither are treatment goals, access, or financial ability. We believe in providing a space where everyone can find the resources, support, and education to advocate for their own version of successful treatment and a pain-free life."},{"header":"Resources","description":"Successful Doctors Map\nThis is a Google Map of the doctors and clinics where members have found successful treatment. Message the mods for additions.\nLaparoscopy Survival Guide\nThis is adapted from an old thread with some great discussions on laps, how to prep, and what recovery is like.\nNancy's Nook Facebook Group\nThis is a private facebook group that has a lot of information, targeted towards patients in the US medical system. They have a list of doctors they recommend (please note that this is not a complete or exhaustive list of excision surgeons or other endometriosis specialists and has not been assessed for surgical skill). Please also be aware that this is not a support group and takes a strict tone with moderation that some may not like.\nEndoMetropolis\nThis is a link to another private Facebook group with a list of excision specialists. They also have some educational tools in the files section. They are a little less strict than Nancy's Nook.\nUK accredited specialist endometriosis centres\nThis is a link to the British Society for Gynaecological Endoscopy website accredited specialist endometriosis centres page. The accredited centres have strict requirements that means they are experienced in complex excision surgeries and have endometriosis specialist nurses and pain management teams. UK residents can request referral to a centre by their GP.\nPain/Symptom Journal\nSometimes getting a doctor to take you seriously, either about your symptoms or about a treatment, can be challenging. A Pain or Symptom Journal can be a great tool to guide your discussions and to monitor your progress.\nDoctor Issues\nThis document goes over how to talk with doctors, advocate for yourself, and when to seek out someone new.\nTests - Ruling Out Other Conditions\nThis document goes over conditions that doctors commonly want to rule out before considering more aggressive treatment when looking at an endo diagnosis. It should be noted, that it is absolutely possible to have endo and one of these other conditions."}]}
