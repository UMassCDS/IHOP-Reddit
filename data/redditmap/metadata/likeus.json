Some orangutans learn how to fish! This dog knows he's at the vet!\nHaving such good memories means they remember their suffering. For instance, these cows are happy for returning to pasture after a long winter.\nEmotionally mammals are very developed, like us. They share with us many of our feelings, such as fear and love.\nTheir emotions can be every bit as troubling as ours. They can be depressed so much they won't even eat!\nEven our distant relatives, the cetaceans are very aware and very playful fellows. This Humpback Whale, for instance, realizes she's been saved from a fishing net and lets her rescuers know she is thankful.\nNon-mammal animals on the other hand appear to be quite different from us, but birds always find ways to puzzle us. Apparently they like to have fun! The crow is probably the smartest bird there is!\nBirds in general are very aware of what their peers are doing.\nEvidence is everywhere!\nEverytime you find evidence remember to share with us.\nThanks for tuning in to the sub ;)"},{"header":"Recommended Subreddits:","description":"/r/AnimalIntelligence\n/r/AnimalsBeingGeniuses\n/r/AnimalsBeingStrange\n/r/AnimalRights\n/r/Animal_Sanctuary\n/r/Animals\n/r/AnimalsDoingStuff\n/r/AnimalsThatLoveMagic\n/r/AnimalTextGifs\n/r/AnimalWelfareScience\n/r/Awwducational\n/r/BabyCorgis\n/r/BabyElephantGifs\n/r/BabyRhinoGifs\n/r/BatFacts\n/r/BeachDogs\n/r/BearsDoingHumanThings\n/r/BeforeNAfterAdoption\n/r/BigBoye\n/r/BirdsTakingTheTrain\n/r/Budgies\n/r/CapyPlops\n/r/ChickenGifs\n/r/Creatures_of_Earth\n/r/DogsWithJobs\n/r/Foxes\n/r/FishCognition\n/r/HappyCowGifs\n/r/HappyDogs\n/r/MasterReturns\n/r/Nature\n/r/NatureApes\n/r/NatureGifs\n/r/PaintedWolves\n/r/PetsAreAmazing\n/r/PetsWithButtons\n/r/PupliftingNews\n/r/OrangutanGifs\n/r/ScienceFacts\n/r/Skatedog\n/r/Spiders\n/r/StopSpeciesism\n/r/TurtleFacts\n/r/UnlikelyFriends\n/r/Whales"}]}
