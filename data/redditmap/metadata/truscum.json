The appeal should display:\n-Understanding of why you were banned,\n-Remorse for the action(s) and/or...\n-Convincing evidence or statement proving that you will not break subreddit rules in the future.\nThe appeal can be submitted in list or paragraph format (through modmail); but please understand that after the appeal is submitted, there is not a guaranteed removal of the ban. It means that subreddit moderators will discuss in detail whether or not it is appropriate to unban the person in question.\nPlease allow the moderators a few days after the submission of your appeal to get back to you."},{"header":"Important Links!","description":"Subreddit Wiki"}]}
