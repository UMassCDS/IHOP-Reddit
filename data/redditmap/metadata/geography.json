In short, geographers are particularly good at determining the \"Why of Where.\"\nSubmission Guidelines\nPlease read the rules before posting!\nDiscussions of all branches and scales of geography are highly encouraged! If you have a question, no matter how basic or complex, ask away.\nAssigning a post flair is required.\nLinks to original sources are preferred.\nPlease do not re-host images or maps at imgur or similar sites. Re-hosting prevents the author(s) from getting the recognition they deserve. It also prevents us, the reader, from seeing the context and background information the image was published in.\nOriginal work is welcome. If you've created a map using real-world data, or written an article or blog post etc, please share. Note that fictitious maps and graphics will be removed.\nFor geoguessing and challenges, see r/geoguessr, r/geoguessing, r/guessthecity, and r/WWTT\nFor memes and jokes, see r/GeoMemes and r/planningmemes\nFor everything related to flags, see r/vexillology\nUser Flair\nIf you have an undergraduate level or higher degree of education in geography or a related field, message the mods to get a custom flair that specifies your specific area of expertise. Otherwise, feel free to add one of our existing flair options for your interest in a specific subfield of geography.\nRelated Subs\n/r/geospatial geography + technology\n/r/GIS geographic information science and systems\n/r/urbanplanning urban geography\n/r/UrbanStudies an academic approach to cities\n/r/socialscience some human geo and related maps here\n/r/geopolitics all the world is a stage\nr/transit/ move between places\n/r/environmental_science study the planet\n/r/EarthScience study the planet some more\n/r/climate it's all around you\n/r/placelearning place, as it relates to mind, body, and culture\n/r/NationalGeographic the big papa of geo\n/r/interculture internationalism, multiculturalism, globalization\n/r/geographie geography, en française\nMaps and Cartography\n/r/Maps the language of geography\n/r/Map_Porn early successor to r/MapPorn\n/r/MapPorn maps: big and small, good and bad.
