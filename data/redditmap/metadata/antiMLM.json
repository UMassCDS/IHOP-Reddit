These can be physical products or services. The company is structured so that the people above (the person who recruited or signed up the new distributor, the people above them, ad infinitum) get a percentage of whatever the distributor sells. The new distributor is encouraged not only to sell the product, but to sign up other people below them so that they can make even more money. courtesy u/copacetic1515\nWhat is a \"Hun\"?\nPeople who shill products/services for an MLM. The sellers have a tendency to frequently use the word \"hun\" when initiating a sales pitch. Ex: ‚ÄúHey hun ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è I see your aunt is dying üò±üò± anyway hun üòäüíÅ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è wanna buy my oils it‚Äôs good for stress üòçüòòüòò‚Äù courtesy u/fiestaspongebob.
