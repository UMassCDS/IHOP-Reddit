This is the place to share those things you find in real life. This isnâ€™t the area for posting digital Easter eggs, as in screenshots or photographs of screens (games, computer software, TV series, DVD menus); as those are regular Easter eggs and not IRL Easter eggs. Try /r/EasterEggs for such things.","created":"Created Oct 10, 2015","stats":["523k Members","319 Online","Top 1% Ranked by Size"]},"other_information":[]}
