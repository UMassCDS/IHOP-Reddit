READ THIS\nPOLICY ABOUT TROLLING\nr/FreeMagic neither encourages nor discourages trolling. We urge our members to not engage directly with people outside of the subreddit until Wizards of the Coast clarifies what constitutes harassment in their eyes. We also take action to enforce reddit's sitewide rules and those voted up by the community.\nWe believe people are mature enough to decide for themselves what content to view, and how, and when.\nMost of the rules were taken directly from r/freefolk, our brother reddit, created for similar reasons as our own. So, if you like Game of Thrones and want a free environment to express yourself, check them out."}]}
