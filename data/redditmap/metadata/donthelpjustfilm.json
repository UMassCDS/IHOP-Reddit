For example, the person filming has to be present and clearly able to help, but more interested in filming. The video should not end mere seconds after an event has occurred, as there would be no way of knowing whether or not the cameraman proceeded to help.\nThe NatGeo picture of the child being eaten by a snake as a cameraman is seen filming has been posted here many times and has been confirmed as staged.
