Submissions should be an impartial discussion prompt + questions.\nKeep it civil, no political name-calling.\nDo not ask loaded or rhetorical questions.\nNo personal opinions/proposals -> r/politicalopinions for those.\n2. Provide some background and context. Offer substantive avenues for discussion.\nAvoid highly speculative posts, all scenarios should within the realm of reasonable possibility.\nDo not request users help you with an argument, educate you, or perform research for you.\nNo posts that boil down to: DAE, ELI5, CMV, TIL, AskA, \"Thoughts?\", \"Discuss!\", or \"How does this affect the election?\"\n3. Everything in the post should be directly related to a political issue.\nNo meta discussion about reddit, subreddits, or redditors.\nWe are not a link subreddit. Don't just post links to news, blogs, surveys, videos, etc.\nPotentially non-politics: Law, sociology, philosophy, celebrities, news, etc.\n4. Formatting and housekeeping things:\nThe title should match the post. Don't use tags like [Serious]\nCheck to make sure another recent post doesn't already cover that topic.\nDon't use all-caps. Format for readability: paragraphs, punctuation, and link containers."},{"header":"Comment Rules","description":"Keep this subreddit HIGH QUALITY by observing Reddiquette and our comment rules:\nKeep it civil.
