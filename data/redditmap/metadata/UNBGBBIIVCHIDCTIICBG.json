You can refer to the sub more simply as r/UNBG, and clicking that will bring you here.\nHere's your transparency.\nDo not contact us if you get banned or if your post gets removed. We will not respond. Do not ask for another chance if you get banned. Reading the rules was your chance. If you get muted, do not contact us again. Muting you was your answer. Because of the nature of this sub and in consideration of its rules, some posts will be locked. Do not contact us to ask why a post gets locked. Votes determine the post outcome here. Because it does not matter what you personally think, reports on posts are auto ignored. So no report from you will be read. Mail for both mods are whitelisted, so no PM from you will be received. Inbox Replies are disabled for both mods. You can create as many alts as you want to modmail us, but you will be talking to yourself. We put this sub on the new modmail system so all mail from you goes to the new modmail instead of the old system. We did that so we would not have to see any of your bullshit. The other mod does not have modmail access. Even if I check modmail in this sub, I promise you I will not unblock you to read your modmail. Unless you have a ton of karma, your message probably won't get past our mute bot anyway."}]}
