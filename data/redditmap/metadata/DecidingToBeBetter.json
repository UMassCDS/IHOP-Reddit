You can do this by making a post, or commenting on another persons post. A new feature we are implementing is monthly progression checks. If you would just like to discuss your adventure of deciding to be better, and document/track your progression, you are invited to participate in those!\nStarting in 2019, we are asking users to flair their posts. After submitting, there is a \"flair\" option under your post body. Please select which flair is most appropriate for your post. This will help you and others find the content they come here for more easily!\nRemember to keep things civil. If somebody is opening up about their mistakes, it doesn't give you the right to ridicule them. Also be genuine when giving advice! you can joke around but most people are here for serious reasons and expect to get serious responses.\nIf you are unsure if your post is appropriate for this subreddit, or have an idea for the sub, message the mods and ask! dont be shy, we welcome any and all questions. :)\nThis is not a place for you to repeatedly advertise your content on other platforms. Please do not share videos you made, articles you wrote, etc., If your account shows little interest in participating in the communities you advertise to, or you are just blasting out posts and hoping one sticks, your submission will be removed, and you may be banned. Again, feel free to message the mods to see if your post is acceptable.\nIf you're having a conversation with somebody in the comment section, or you see a comment/post you enjoy, please upvote them! You obviously don't have to, but its nice giving each other internet points, isn't it? When you see a post with no votes or no comments, you could potentially make the OP feel at least listened to with your votes or comments! Its hard for everyone to make the front page, so show some love to the \"new\" section too!\nAdvice Help Journey Progression Resource Story\nPlease refer to our Wiki/FAQ!"}]}
