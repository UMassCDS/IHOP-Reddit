It supports old-school dialup modem access, as well as telnet & web!\nThe RetroBattlestations community is about using, repairing, replicating, emulating, and reminiscing about retro & vintage battlestations. Posts should be about using retro equipment or news about retro stuff, whether it’s personal projects, new products, old articles, or reusing old hardware in new ways.\nFeel free to show off your machines, but please keep your posts about actual battlestations. No pictures of old software, documentation, accessories, unless a complete battlestation is included.\n\"Wanted\" posts and free items for pickup are ok (as text/self posts, include your location & [Wanted] or [Free] in title), but \"for sale\" posts, ebay links, or \"what's this stuff worth\" posts are not. No you didn't just find a pot of gold or win the lottery, and if you did, there's a better place for that."},{"header":"Challenges and Contests","description":"Calendar of upcoming events\nFeb 11-19: BBS Week VIII\nDec 16-31: Holiday Music Week\nNov 19-27: Portable Week\nOct 8-16: Frankenstein Week\nAug 21-28: Demo Week\nJul 10-31: BASIC Month 7: Make-a-Face\nMay 21-29: DOS Compatible Week\nApr 16-24: xkcd Week\nMar 19-27: Team Orange/Green/Blue\nFeb 12-20: BBS Week VII\nComplete list of past contests"},{"header":"Need software?","description":"Apple II: ADTPro disk transfer\nApple II: ASCII Express\nApple II: Asimov ftp site\nApple II, Mac, Newton: Archive.org mirror of download.info.apple.com\nNeXT: NeXTComputers.org\nMac: Macintosh Garden\nCommodore 64: transferring to disk\nTRS-80: Software for almost every model\nTRS-80 CoCo: DriveWire\nTRS-80 CoCo: Color Computer Archive\nTRS-80 MC-10: Jim and Charlie Gerrie's Software Page\nBBC Micro: MDFS.net\nDOS: Vetusware\nDOS, Windows, Mac: WinWorld\nZX Spectrum: World of Spectrum\nOric-1/Atmos: oric.org\nCP/M: Don Maslin Vintage Computer Archive\nAmiga: aminet.net\nColeco Adam: Adam Archive"}]}
