No more than 1 post/Â½ hour and 5 posts/day\nAll posts must be current California news and info, plus be of interest to folks from across the state. (Some California history is also cool.)\nNo satire.\nIf a post is of only local interest, or the only connection is a person was born or lives in California or is a company is based in California, or it's entertainment or celebrity news, it is not appropriate. This also includes local crime reports and local politics.\nTry to post more detailed articles from local news sources instead of brief news wire articles from an out-of-state newspaper.\nNo political news unless it is specifically about California or is about California politicians as they relate to California.\nCalifornia is HUGE. If your title doesn't include it, add the location in brackets like this [Santa Ana, CA]. If it is a small city or CDP, include the county or region, eg [Bell, Los Angeles County].\nFor local or regional questions, try /r/AskLosAngeles, /r/AskSF, or /r/AskSanDiego or other local subs instead.\nFor questions, please be as detailed and specific as possible to make it easier to answer your question.\nEspecially if you have a DMV, vacation, travel, working here, or moving here question, please search the sub's archives because it's likely your question has been answered multiple times in the past.\nPlease don't say Frisco, San Fran, The OC, Diego, or Cali. Most Californians don't use those nicknames.\nAll image posts must be by the original creator, have a link crediting the original creator, or have a link to the original source(s) of the image(s). All photos must be high quality images worth posting to one of the SFW Porn Network, such as /r/EarthPorn, and clearly identifiable as a California photo.\nNo ALL CAPS words or text, no bold text, and no #Headline text formatting!
