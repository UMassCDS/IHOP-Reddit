After several discussions we gathered some key points about Meme-Comments and Meme-Posts.\nThe information below can be summarized as: Don't post memes if it will make it difficult for others to reach and discuss important information.\nThis community offers a place for discussion. This community offers a place to learn. It's built for productivity.\nNevertheless, we aren't an academic ivory tower of old sages. We are diverse and we also want to build a community with real people. Humour is an important part of that.\nIf that humour starts to strip value from a post or from the community in anyway though, we will act accordingly.\nWhat does that mean? It means that we will remove Meme-Content based on the current ratio of valuable content and memes:\nIf daily new meme-posts start to drown news, DD or similar, they will be removed.\nMeme-posts under discussion-threads, DDs and news will be removed.\nComments to meme-posts aren't regulated in any way apart from the applying rules."}]}
