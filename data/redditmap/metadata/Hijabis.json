We encourage questions and different opinions but they must be expressed respectfully. We will ban you for being a jerk, being judgmental, or otherwise unsupportive.\nEven if a sister is doing something haraam, the expectation is that you will keep this as a safe space for her to make the right decisions on her own by not being judgmental.\nThe path to hijab is a difficult one and it is our goal to support the women who decide to take this path regardless of how far along they are on this journey.\nQuestions and inquires from non-Muslims are welcome!\nPlease read our rules and FAQ before posting and/or commenting.\nFor a list of Modest Clothing shops (we do not endorse any of them) see here.

And O ye Believers! turn ye all together towards Allah, that ye may attain Bliss. (English - Yusuf Ali)\nSurah Al-Ahzab, Verse 59: O Prophet! Tell thy wives and daughters, and the believing women, that they should cast their outer garments over their persons (when abroad): that is most convenient, that they should be known (as such) and not molested. And Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.\nHadithBukhari 6:282 'Aisha used to say: \"When (the Verse): 'They should draw their veils over their necks and bosoms,' was revealed, (the ladies) cut their waist sheets at the edges and covered their faces with the cut pieces.\""}]}
