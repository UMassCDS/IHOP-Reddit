We do not tolerate cruelty to sharks and will delete any posts encouraging touching animals in their native environments. We respect that the ocean is their world - we are just tourists. There are also very few shark attacks globally - way less than you would think.","created":"Created Jan 18, 2010","stats":["136k Members","120 Online","Top 1% Ranked by Size"]},"other_information":[{"header":"Quick Links","description":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shark"}]}
