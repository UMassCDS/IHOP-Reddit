Anarcho-capitalism is a political philosophy that advocates for the elimination of the state in favor of individual sovereignty, private property, and free market production of law and justice. Anarcho-capitalists believe that in the absence of a state or ruler, society would improve itself through empowering individual choice and the discipline of the free market, or what its proponents describe as a voluntary society.\nRacism and Social Justice are considered off-topic here; libertarianism does not have a racial component. All posts related to racism and social justice must have some obvious link to libertarianism and may be removed at moderator discretion.\nTHIS IS A MEMBERS-ONLY COMMUNITY\nThis subreddit is a private association of individuals, and participation is restricted to members-only.\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE INFO\nRead the most recent COMMENTS\nRules\nLearn the basics of ancap philosophy: /r/AnCap101\nDavid Friedman on How to Privatize Everything from AnCap Primer playlist\nThe Gold and Black Starter Pack for those new to Anarcho-capitalism.\nSubreddit Macros\nPast AMAs\nMurray Mondays\nGold & Black Book Club\nOfficial discord server\nFAQ about the discord server\nPodcasts of Interest\nAssociated Communities:\nAssociated Communities:\nr/AnCap101\nr/ancap_bookclub\nr/AnCapCopyPasta\nr/ancapgaming\nr/AnCap_Investing\nr/AnCapMeme\nr/ancapraxis\nr/AskLibertarians\nr/btc\nr/bitcoincash\nr/CapitalismVSocialism\nr/antiwar\nr/austrian_economics\nr/EndDemocracy\nr/LateStageStatism\nr/LearnLiberty/\nr/Liberland\nr/Libertarian\nr/LibertarianCA\nr/libertarianbestof\nr/LibertarianLectures\nr/libertarianmeme\nr/NewAustrianSociety\nr/polycentric_law\nr/QualitySocialism\nr/Rational_Liberty\nr/ShitStatistsSay\nr/socialismfacts\nThis subreddit is night mode compatible\nWell-Kept Gardens Die By Pacifism - why we chose to keep this sub an on-topic sub and remove participants who do not talk about things of interest to ancaps.\nOur position on Free Speech: https://imgur.com/xE0K4D9.png\nView past GnB memes:\nhttps://imgur.com/r/GoldandBlack\nIf you're looking for the subreddit related to images and artwork involving the colors Gold and Black, that's over at /r/blackandgold"},{"header":"Libertarian Websites","description":"https://aier.org\nhttps://antiwar.com\nhttps://bleedingheartlibertarians.com\nhttps://cafehayek.com\nhttps://cato.org\nhttp://econlib.org\nhttps://economicpolicyjournal.com\nhttp://econtalk.org\nhttps://fee.org\nhttps://fff.org\nhttps://ij.org\nhttps://independent.org\nhttps://libertarianism.org\nhttp://libertarianpapers.org\nhttps://lp.org\nhttps://marginalrevolution.com\nhttps://mercatus.org\nhttps://mises.org\nhttps://reason.com\nhttp://reason.tv\nhttps://theadvocates.org"}]}
