However, it must still be a relevant post according to the other rules without the script aspect. If the focus of your post is on the script, post to /r/Neography instead.\nPhoneme inventories\nPosts on phonology can be made interesting, of course, but a mere phoneme inventory provides very little to comment on. Please put some extra work into allophony, morphophonology and/or phonotactics.\nCalls for collaboration or requests for resources\nIf you need a place to post these, use our stickied Small Discussions Thread.\nRepetitive Posts\nFrequent posts about the same project are discouraged. Post small updates in our stickied Small Discussions thread and only make a post for major milestones."},{"header":"Small Discussions","description":"This thread is always found on our frontpage.
