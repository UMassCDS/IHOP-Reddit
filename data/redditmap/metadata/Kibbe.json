David Kibbe is best known for his work as a stylist and image consultant in New York City. In 1987 he published his acclaimed book, Metamorphosis: Discover Your Image Identity and Dazzle as Only You Can. In his book he discusses the 13 (now 10) Image Identities, based on the Old Hollywood Archetypes, and how one can embody these style archetypes through their clothing and essence. David‚Äôs work differs from other styling systems that seek to ‚Äúcorrect‚Äù one‚Äôs body into a conventional hourglass. Instead, he seeks to harmonize with one‚Äôs natural yin-yang balance by having their clothing imitate their natural shapes in their silhouette. The Kibbe system is about creating a style that is authentically you, embracing your natural features and enhancing them. \nThe Kibbe system is a tool to help people learn the importance of creating a head-to-toe look and occasion for which you are dressing. Additionally, it will teach you about your accommodations and how clothing interacts with you body. This system is a tool to develop your style, not a body typing system. It takes a holistic view of the body and help us to have ‚Äúenlightened subjectivity‚Äù when looking at ourselves. The journey may be long, but will result in a better understanding of personal style."},{"header":"Disclaimer","description":"This is a body positive sub, and Kibbe's styling system is body positive. If you are looking for hot & not \"body types\", then it might not be for you - none of the Image IDs are a negative one. If you are looking for which IDs are more \"feminine\", then again, this might not be the system for you; and yin/yang do not equate feminine/masculine in their original meaning, nor in the Kibbe system appropriated meaning. This sub is NOT affiliated with vindicta, redpill, and the like."},{"header":"Book extracts","description":"Please note: The book contains some bits that are considered outdated today.\nDramatic\nSoft Dramatic\nFlamboyant Natural\nNatural\nSoft Natural\nDramatic Classic\nClassic\nSoft Classic\nFlamboyant Gamine\nGamine\nSoft Gamine\nTheatrical Romantic\nRomantic"},{"header":"Visual glossary","description":"Visual glossary regarding styling, however ~unofficial~ :)\nLine break\nCurve accommodation for R ‚â† bodycon\nDramatic outfit vs stereotype"},{"header":"Image IDs are not aesthetics","description":"Clothing has no ID\nBreaking stereotypes: TR‚Äôs in playful aesthetic and SG‚Äôs in glam aesthetic\nBreaking stereotypes: romantics in suits, dramatics in floral dresses\nBreaking stereotypes: classics in animated/detailed styles VS gamines in simple/classic styles\nBreaking stereotypes: naturals in non-boho styles.

Even those who have access to the (now outdated) book fail to interpret terms like \"true hourglass\" with the silent generation context in mind (where it refers to round shapes coming from the flesh, not WHR). They also fail to interpret the clothing descriptions - which come from an 80s book referring to Old Hollywood concepts. Example: a dress with a loosely defined waist is this, not this.\nFabric, Kibbe, and You: A Crash Course\nAn amazing post on fabric and dressing for your own lines.\nStrictly Kibbe Facebook group\nA Facebook group where David Kibbe is active himself; contains a lot of resources for learning about the system and dressing for your own silhouette; updated info and clarifications in regards to the now outdated book."},{"header":"Helpful threads","description":"From the main menu: Kibbe Glossary - Silhouette Terms - How to Outfit? - Black List\nA DIY Kibbe Graduates Guide to Kibbe Newbies\n(an introduction)\nA reminder about image ID and body diversity\n(on diversity within the IDs - they are not boxes within which all people must look the same)\nAddressing common misconceptions from Youtube & TikTok\nSome misconceptions about the system\nWhy the feedback on your image ID help posts should be taken with a grain of salt\nWhat are ‚Äúpersonal lines‚Äù and why we should use those instead of ‚ÄúFG/D/R etc. lines‚Äù\n(on using Kibbe as a tool, not a way of putting people into boxes)\nNewbies guide to vertical line\nVertical is not about looking tall or short\n(on Kibbe vertical line)\nI keep seeing people commenting on typing posts that people don‚Äôt seem ‚Äúwide enough‚Äù to be a natural.
