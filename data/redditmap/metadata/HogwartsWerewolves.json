One or two games are hosted each month by a variety of game facilitators. Sign ups open on the 25th of the preceding month. New players cannot join ongoing games and may join the following month.\nThe theme, roles, and gameplay may vary each month as the facilitator chooses, but the premise remains the same: an evil team attacks the good team at night and the good team tries to vote out evil team members during the day. Only living players can actively participate in the game threads. There is an accompanying private subreddit, /r/HogwartsGhosts, that players are added to as they die to freely discuss the game."},{"header":"Rules","description":"Breaking any of the rules below may result in removal from the current game or a ban from future games.
