Absolute, LoJack for laptops) is Not Activated\nBlog posts are encouraged.\nWhen buying a new ThinkPad, consider taking the IPS screen option if possible, as it doesn't cost much. Not only will it have better brightness, colour, contrast and viewing angles - you will most probably more than make up the investment when selling it. Corporate bulk purchasers don't usually go for it. (Comparison video)\nThe only tools you need for servicing a ThinkPad are a set of small screwdrivers and a nylon spudger (for taking the screen and keyboard bezels off), and possibly a pair of tweezers. A can of compressed air may be useful too, and a bottle of isopropyl alcohol and cotton buds are good for cleaning, but not on the screen. Never use acetone (nail polish remover).\nWhen reinstalling Windows, try the Lenovo disc images, as longer battery times have been reported, probably due to custom drivers.\nFeel free to add useful information to the subreddit wiki."},{"header":"More Useful Links","description":"ThinkPad buyer's guide for n00bs\nThinkPads.com Support Community\nLenovo Outlet (US)\nLenovo Parts Removal and Replacement Videos (select ThinkPad tab)\nLenovo Windows Digital Download Recovery Images\nYouTube Lenovo Service Channel\nMirror of Hardware Maintenance Manuals for discontinued models\nLenovo Parts Lookup\nLenovo Accessory Compatibility Matrix\nLenovo Battery Recall\nLenovo Photo Library (including lots of wallpapers)\nIRC Channel (##ibmthinkpad on Libera)"}]}
