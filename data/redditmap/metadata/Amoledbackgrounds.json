The images in this subreddit have been designed to be primarily true black (#000000). As it turns out, AMOLED displays turn off the individual pixels meant to display true black, thereby giving an infinite contrast ratio which makes pictures look more vibrant. Plus, it can save power and it's easier on the eyes in lower-lit environments.\nContribute if you can and vote on the content you like!
