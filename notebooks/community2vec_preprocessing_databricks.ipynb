In this sense you defend an action taken in response to their thinking, just not the kind of action. The kind of thinking that leads to genocide is not rational, its not sensible, and its not fair.

You know saying that is fucked up and you know the impulse to consider the action that way and then express it says something terrible about how the speaker is envisioning the dynamics of the relationship.\n\nWhen people are tried for crimes the things you're saying are used as mitigation.

I doubt he was the first to pioneer it but I've always called them Wheeler handles or Wheeler knock off's because he does it correctly while the majority fall short.\n\nI love the look of these handles in photo's but the pinky swell is almost always too wide/fat for my tastes. Not a fan of having my index grip tighter than my pinky's. I prefer an equal grip across the handle or slight tapering towards the rear.\n\nI understand the idea behind the design but it is actually counter intuitive for such a small knife. The flair is better suited on a chopper above 10\" in blade length. Think Kukri handles.\n\nIf my pinky doesn't touch or nearly touch the inside of my palm when I grip it, it's too fat and diminish the overall grip. I'm not a big guy but I have piano fingers and if the blade wont fit my hand it wont fit a 6' 5\" mans hand correctly either with there extra body fat.\n\nIf you want a great example of these in slight variations look too Nick Wheeler. He does it right. You'll notice the pinky swell on most of his models are obviously smaller than the index grip unlike the one in the linked photo. And if they are not they are more dramatically shaped at the rear. Doesn't look as pretty but I feel it's more practical.\n\nHere's a great [example](https://www.instagram.com/p/BXwy6dKFuew/?taken-by=nick_wheeler_knives_and_newfs). It may be hard to tell for some but that extra meat being removed will make a world of difference in the hand.\n\nQuick test for people at home. Hold your hand up. Is your pinky as long as your index? If no then the swell should not be thicker than your index unless your intention is to make a chopper. Equal grip across the boards makes for a more versatile grip but the blades shape truly dictates the knifes usage so plan accordingly.",1506816009],["dnqik93","t1_dnqefo4",17,"t3_73e5oq","SonOfYossarian","asoiaf","Yeah.

Show me where I said abandon your mortgage, kids and wife.\n\nYou stated to leave the premises, by virtue of American law, having left the premises is considered abandonment of the home and the children in the home. This is well proven through the amazingly broken family court system. \n\nIf you leave the home, you can pretty much write off ever seeing your children again unless you are independently wealthy and the wife/girlfriend does not have access to the accounts. \n\n&gt;I’ve about had my fill of Internet warriors who put words in people’s mouths, instead of owning their assumptions and having an adult conversion.\n\nI made no assumptions, you said to leave the premises, then you said you didn't mean it, that it was \"figurative\". \n\nSay what you mean and you won't have all of these \"internet warriors\" putting words in your mouth. In fact, if it happens so often, perhaps you should stop bitching about it, and start asking why it is that your statements are so often incorrectly read differently than you meant them. \n\n&gt;So, please, fucking show me how I minced words.\n\nOK.\n\nYou said. \n\n&gt;Woman hits you, you leave the premise one way or another.\n\n\nThen you stated what that meant was:\n\n&gt; I didn’t mean, “leave right now and never look back”. More like, walk out of the room or building to let things simmer down a bit.\n\n\nTo which I reminded you that in the American legal system, doing so is seen as willful abandonment and will count against you in court the majority of the time. \n\nSo first you said leave the premises, then said you didn't mean to literally leave, just go to another room. Cause women can only hit you standing in one spot, they could never possibly follow you. It's their one weakness right. \n\nAs an aside, you have made the mistake numerous times now, it is \"premises\", not \"premise\".

There is an office supply store near me that still has 9.7 inch iPad Pros on display as well as the new iPad 2017, and I'm not kidding, I thought they mislabeled the demo units. I was so convinced they had swapped the labels on the demo units that I had to put the serial numbers in a search engine to verify that the iPad 2017 and the iPad Pro 9.7 were properly labeled.\n\nIf you know what to look for, it's more clear, but it is hard to tell the units apart if you're doing it for the first time.\n\nIncidentally, the screen on the iPad 2017 is not \"bad\". In fact, if you Google the Notebookcheck measurements of the screen, it's actually quite accurate. (In terms of measured DeltaE within the sRGB gamut, both grey and color, it's actually better than the measurements Notebookcheck got for the 10.5 iPad Pro -- though individual numbers aren't everything and there will obviously be variation between panels.)\n\nTwo good things about the iPad 2017 that I've noticed: \n\n* There is less color variation severely off-angle than both generations of the iPad Pros. I think this is due to the difference in coatings, or perhaps the presence of the sensing layer for the Apple Pencil.\n\n* The anti-fingerprint oleophobic coating on the iPad 2017 is definitely more effective than on the Pros. I think they had to compromise there to support the Apple Pencil.\n\nThere is a little more brightness variation on the iPad 2017 in comparison to the Pros, and of course there is no support for an extended gamut or 120 Hz. But on the positive side, I find the iPad 2017 is easier to hold in the hand because of the bezel size and the slightly smaller screen is better for reading eBooks.\n\nI wouldn't hesitate to buy the iPad 2017.

A rib cooker singles out some young guy wearing a white \"Where's the beef?\" T-shirt, standing off to the side. He says \"Hey buddy! That T-shirt ain't going to stay white for long\" as he points to his immaculately clean white apron, confusing those watching the exchange. The young guy says \"oh, I won't be *eating* any ribs\", and honestly his emphasis of the word *eating* creeped me out a bit, but whatever. So the cook huddles with associates and seem to come to some type of agreement and calls back over to the young guy \"Hey Buddy! Come here a minute!\" So he walks over and the cook turns on a loud white noise machine and we can't hear what they're saying. After a lot of emphatic hand waving, head nodding &amp; shaking, and some frantic scribbling and erasing on a white board, the young man walks over to the rib line (which is pretty long at this point since no one's been serving ribs). Everyone in line does a triple-take as the man takes his place in line, and the whole line is now murmuring to each other trying to make sense of it all. Someone finally incredulously asks \"What could the cook *possibly* have said to you to convince you to eat after you already declined one single time?!?\" The man smiles and says \"Well you see, I'm a VEGAN and can't eat meat, so the cook had offered to clean off the grill and make me some scrambled eggs instead.\" And one of the people in line says \"I didn't know they had scrambled eggs!

The line continues to swell as more people hear the rumor of scramble eggs and eventually all the Vegans at Ribfest make their way to the line. Finally, the puzzled man speaks up, \"Excuse me, I know this is none of my business, but do you mean vegetarian?\" The original white shirt guy gives his own puzzled look in return. So the puzzled man clarifies \"Well it's just that you said you're a vegan but you're about to eat eggs, which are an animal product - plus I think there's probably milk in it too if they're doing it right\" Someone else shouts \"And vanilla extract!\" And the puzzled guy says \"Yeah, maybe. But that's not an animal product. Anyways, I think maybe you meant vegetarian rather than vegan, since it sounds like you don't eat meat rather than all animal products?\" White shirt: \"Vegan, vegetarian, what's the difference?\" Puzzled guy: \"Um, well, I *just* explained the difference. You know what? Never mind; it's none of my business anyway.\" Then someone pipes up \"Won't the egg mixture just run through the grill?\" \"Maybe they have a skillet?\" someone replied. \n\nAfter all the eggs were handed out everyone held hands and ate their eggs (with their faces pressed into the paper plates since they didn't have their hands free). It was the most beautiful thing I've ever witnessed; people of all genders coming together and eating scramble eggs with their faces. I shed a single tear and clapped, a slow non-sarcastic clap.

M113s, Grizzly, Cougar and Husky armored vehicles, multiple artillery batteries, Air Force helicopters for infantry air assaults, air defense batteries, thousands of mortar rounds, the fucking FN, New MLVW's, Rambo tier amounts of M72's, parade squares that fit 1500 soldiers and full support battalions were normal things. Sometimes Reg force was fully/partially involved, sometimes they weren't.\n\nCompared to now. \nMaybe 300 or 400 reservists will go one exercise if the Land Force Area can afford it that year. No M113's, no LAV's, Shit ass LSVW/Milverado/G-Wagon/MLVW vehicles. No artillery except the 4 forty year old field guns that the artillery platoons have in the whole province. Maybe the Air Force will be able to afford to send out 1 or 2 unarmed helicopters for a day or two. Maybe the medics will set up a tent if they can get enough members to go on exercise. The food will come from the base kitchen or will be MRE's because the service battalions are incapable of getting enough people or equipment to provide those services. Any M72 training will be 35mm training insert on a reused tube. Your unit and the exerciser run out of training rounds so you literally say \"Bang Bang\" when \"shooting\". Soldiers get encouraged to stay home on range qualification days because their units can't afford to qualify everyone on even the C7 let alone the machine guns.\n\nThat same parade square has crumbled so much that it could only parade two under strength platoons. The military can't afford to fix it, and there is no point in fixing it really. The reserves totally depend on the Regular force as well.\n\n\nThat and the older aged higher ranking NCO's that are just riding it out to top up their pension.\n\n\nReservists are part time.

How would you provide studies if the methodology and composition couldn't be known by third parties? NDAs are a modest solution but everyone has a price.

It incentivizes industrial espionage which is usually damaging and illegal and harmful.\n\nHowever IP as it currently exists has flaws. Right now the incentive is not to get a patent and get back to inventing because it is more profitable to get a patent and use it as a bludgeon to sue for damages and prevent others from innovating. Inventing and progress must wait on the patent to expire which does more harm to innovation than the patent protects.

(Mine which will be 1.01 or 1.02 at the worst, two probable mids, and two probable late).\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n- I realize Kelce is a great asset. I do have Mahomes, which would make for a great stack in the future. But Kelce will probably be at the end of his prime by the time I am truly competitive. Kelce is my second oldest player. (Luck is my oldest). Kelce has also only had 1 elite year as a TE in fantasy. 2014/2015 were decent, but nothing like last year. They also didn't have Kareem Hunt last year and Hill was a \"gadget\" rookie.</td><td>1506816005</td></tr><tr><td>dnqik5x</td><td>t1_dnqh3xy</td><td>7</td><td>t3_73hlkb</td><td>lepigpengaming</td><td>MMA</td><td>A lot of these guys shouldn't be calling out Tony but the guys Tony should be fighting are AFK...

In this sense you defend an action taken in response to their thinking, just not the kind of action. The kind of thinking that leads to genocide is not rational, its not sensible, and its not fair. There is no just motive that makes people believe in mass rape. That is hate. Your entire premise is that there's a just way to think of another people in a way that can make you want to do this.\n\n&gt;which is that you think I'm excusing rape\n\nOn some level you are to an extent. Its like if someone said \"so and so got raped by her ex\" and someone replied \"well she did screw him over hard in the divorce\". You know saying that is fucked up and you know the impulse to consider the action that way and then express it says something terrible about how the speaker is envisioning the dynamics of the relationship.\n\nWhen people are tried for crimes the things you're saying are used as mitigation. The reasoning behind an act is used to lessen or strengthen the condemnation and ensuing punishment for the act. On any level where you look at how our value system manifests judgment for actions taken you are mitigating it.\n\n&gt;The problem with your argument is that nowhere did I say I supported the how of the Burmese actions\n\nI already acknowledged that. I said that doesn't matter and I have explained why. Your prejudice against Islam allows you to justify however thinking in these grotesque terms and think you're clean in doing so.</td><td>1506816008</td></tr><tr><td>dnqik8d</td><td>t1_dnqhsmb</td><td>1</td><td>t3_73ht4j</td><td>mechkbot</td><td>mechmarket</td><td>added</td><td>1506816008</td></tr><tr><td>dnqik8e</td><td>t1_dnqevbw</td><td>1</td><td>t3_73cxk0</td><td>Little_Baller</td><td>makinghiphop</td><td>I like the mood you have with this beat.

Same for using California plates in Ontario, Canada.\n\nToll collection authorities will only track down out-of-state plates that they expect to show up frequently. For example, New York is often visited by drivers from Ontario and Massachusetts, so if you're from those places and try to use NY tolled roads without an EZPass you will get nailed. Likewise, Ontario will track drivers from Quebec, Michigan, and NY for sure. But if your car is registered in California, then it's highly unlikely that they'll bother to track you down. It costs them money to do so, and California-plated cars are a rare sight in that region.</td><td>1506816008</td></tr><tr><td>dnqik8g</td><td>t3_73hjti</td><td>1</td><td>t3_73hjti</td><td>M_Fischer</td><td>uvtrade</td><td>Interested in Beauty and the Beast, or Incredibles\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/uvtrade/comments/72lsuf/offer_guardians_of_the_galaxy_2_diary_of_a_wimpy/</td><td>1506816008</td></tr><tr><td>dnqik8h</td><td>t1_dnpksqs</td><td>2</td><td>t3_73dl3a</td><td>MissAtomicBomb7</td><td>KendrickLamar</td><td>Fam we gon organize. #teamcro</td><td>1506816008</td></tr><tr><td>dnqik8i</td><td>t1_dnq9pr4</td><td>1</td><td>t3_73fpvg</td><td>LinealFury</td><td>manchester</td><td>I like Arriva as they have charge points and are cheaper </td><td>1506816009</td></tr><tr><td>dnqik8j</td><td>t3_73i0ip</td><td>1</td><td>t3_73i0ip</td><td>hauntedskin</td><td>Bulges</td><td>Git ur ass over to r/tightywhities</td><td>1506816009</td></tr><tr><td>dnqik8k</td><td>t1_dnqi9x4</td><td>2</td><td>t3_73gli1</td><td>goshordr</td><td>CFB</td><td>Yeah, pretty sure that was against the wind but he definitely shanked that one regardless</td><td>1506816009</td></tr><tr><td>dnqik8l</td><td>t1_dnq7509</td><td>3</td><td>t3_73f7dx</td><td>Holland45</td><td>videos</td><td>*aboot\nCanadians where right the whole time</td><td>1506816009</td></tr><tr><td>dnqik8m</td><td>t3_73ig8p</td><td>1</td><td>t3_73ig8p</td><td>AutoModerator</td><td>worldpowers</td><td>If you would like a battle run for this conflict post, you must post it in the appropriate [MODPOST] thread designated for collecting [CONFLICT] posts.\n\n#####&amp;#009;\n\n######&amp;#009;\n\n####&amp;#009;\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I doubt he was the first to pioneer it but I've always called them Wheeler handles or Wheeler knock off's because he does it correctly while the majority fall short.\n\nI love the look of these handles in photo's but the pinky swell is almost always too wide/fat for my tastes. Not a fan of having my index grip tighter than my pinky's. I prefer an equal grip across the handle or slight tapering towards the rear.\n\nI understand the idea behind the design but it is actually counter intuitive for such a small knife. The flair is better suited on a chopper above 10\" in blade length. Think Kukri handles.\n\nIf my pinky doesn't touch or nearly touch the inside of my palm when I grip it, it's too fat and diminish the overall grip. I'm not a big guy but I have piano fingers and if the blade wont fit my hand it wont fit a 6' 5\" mans hand correctly either with there extra body fat.\n\nIf you want a great example of these in slight variations look too Nick Wheeler. He does it right. You'll notice the pinky swell on most of his models are obviously smaller than the index grip unlike the one in the linked photo. And if they are not they are more dramatically shaped at the rear. Doesn't look as pretty but I feel it's more practical.\n\nHere's a great [example](https://www.instagram.com/p/BXwy6dKFuew/?taken-by=nick_wheeler_knives_and_newfs). It may be hard to tell for some but that extra meat being removed will make a world of difference in the hand.\n\nQuick test for people at home. Hold your hand up. Is your pinky as long as your index? If no then the swell should not be thicker than your index unless your intention is to make a chopper. Equal grip across the boards makes for a more versatile grip but the blades shape truly dictates the knifes usage so plan accordingly.</td><td>1506816009</td></tr><tr><td>dnqik93</td><td>t1_dnqefo4</td><td>17</td><td>t3_73e5oq</td><td>SonOfYossarian</td><td>asoiaf</td><td>Yeah.

Show me where I said abandon your mortgage, kids and wife.\n\nYou stated to leave the premises, by virtue of American law, having left the premises is considered abandonment of the home and the children in the home. This is well proven through the amazingly broken family court system. \n\nIf you leave the home, you can pretty much write off ever seeing your children again unless you are independently wealthy and the wife/girlfriend does not have access to the accounts. \n\n&gt;I’ve about had my fill of Internet warriors who put words in people’s mouths, instead of owning their assumptions and having an adult conversion.\n\nI made no assumptions, you said to leave the premises, then you said you didn't mean it, that it was \"figurative\". \n\nSay what you mean and you won't have all of these \"internet warriors\" putting words in your mouth. In fact, if it happens so often, perhaps you should stop bitching about it, and start asking why it is that your statements are so often incorrectly read differently than you meant them. \n\n&gt;So, please, fucking show me how I minced words.\n\nOK.\n\nYou said. \n\n&gt;Woman hits you, you leave the premise one way or another.\n\n\nThen you stated what that meant was:\n\n&gt; I didn’t mean, “leave right now and never look back”. More like, walk out of the room or building to let things simmer down a bit.\n\n\nTo which I reminded you that in the American legal system, doing so is seen as willful abandonment and will count against you in court the majority of the time. \n\nSo first you said leave the premises, then said you didn't mean to literally leave, just go to another room. Cause women can only hit you standing in one spot, they could never possibly follow you. It's their one weakness right. \n\nAs an aside, you have made the mistake numerous times now, it is \"premises\", not \"premise\".

There is an office supply store near me that still has 9.7 inch iPad Pros on display as well as the new iPad 2017, and I'm not kidding, I thought they mislabeled the demo units. I was so convinced they had swapped the labels on the demo units that I had to put the serial numbers in a search engine to verify that the iPad 2017 and the iPad Pro 9.7 were properly labeled.\n\nIf you know what to look for, it's more clear, but it is hard to tell the units apart if you're doing it for the first time.\n\nIncidentally, the screen on the iPad 2017 is not \"bad\". In fact, if you Google the Notebookcheck measurements of the screen, it's actually quite accurate. (In terms of measured DeltaE within the sRGB gamut, both grey and color, it's actually better than the measurements Notebookcheck got for the 10.5 iPad Pro -- though individual numbers aren't everything and there will obviously be variation between panels.)\n\nTwo good things about the iPad 2017 that I've noticed: \n\n* There is less color variation severely off-angle than both generations of the iPad Pros. I think this is due to the difference in coatings, or perhaps the presence of the sensing layer for the Apple Pencil.\n\n* The anti-fingerprint oleophobic coating on the iPad 2017 is definitely more effective than on the Pros. I think they had to compromise there to support the Apple Pencil.\n\nThere is a little more brightness variation on the iPad 2017 in comparison to the Pros, and of course there is no support for an extended gamut or 120 Hz. But on the positive side, I find the iPad 2017 is easier to hold in the hand because of the bezel size and the slightly smaller screen is better for reading eBooks.\n\nI wouldn't hesitate to buy the iPad 2017. I think it's one of the best deals Apple has ever offered.</td><td>1506816015</td></tr><tr><td>dnqiket</td><td>t3_73hs64</td><td>1</td><td>t3_73hs64</td><td>SkShark</td><td>dankmemes</td><td>r/me_irl</td><td>1506816015</td></tr><tr><td>dnqikeu</td><td>t1_dnownvv</td><td>1</td><td>t3_736uui</td><td>MTsumi</td><td>StarWarsBattlefront</td><td>I don't know, I think the xim4 is a pretty good one.

A rib cooker singles out some young guy wearing a white \"Where's the beef?\" T-shirt, standing off to the side. He says \"Hey buddy! That T-shirt ain't going to stay white for long\" as he points to his immaculately clean white apron, confusing those watching the exchange. The young guy says \"oh, I won't be *eating* any ribs\", and honestly his emphasis of the word *eating* creeped me out a bit, but whatever. So the cook huddles with associates and seem to come to some type of agreement and calls back over to the young guy \"Hey Buddy! Come here a minute!\" So he walks over and the cook turns on a loud white noise machine and we can't hear what they're saying. After a lot of emphatic hand waving, head nodding &amp; shaking, and some frantic scribbling and erasing on a white board, the young man walks over to the rib line (which is pretty long at this point since no one's been serving ribs). Everyone in line does a triple-take as the man takes his place in line, and the whole line is now murmuring to each other trying to make sense of it all. Someone finally incredulously asks \"What could the cook *possibly* have said to you to convince you to eat after you already declined one single time?!?\" The man smiles and says \"Well you see, I'm a VEGAN and can't eat meat, so the cook had offered to clean off the grill and make me some scrambled eggs instead.\" And one of the people in line says \"I didn't know they had scrambled eggs! I want that\". Others joined in \"Me too!\" \"I'll pay double!\" \"Triple!\" \"Money is no object!\" It was pandemonium. Another man stands in line with very puzzled look on his face. The line continues to swell as more people hear the rumor of scramble eggs and eventually all the Vegans at Ribfest make their way to the line. Finally, the puzzled man speaks up, \"Excuse me, I know this is none of my business, but do you mean vegetarian?\" The original white shirt guy gives his own puzzled look in return. So the puzzled man clarifies \"Well it's just that you said you're a vegan but you're about to eat eggs, which are an animal product - plus I think there's probably milk in it too if they're doing it right\" Someone else shouts \"And vanilla extract!\" And the puzzled guy says \"Yeah, maybe. But that's not an animal product. Anyways, I think maybe you meant vegetarian rather than vegan, since it sounds like you don't eat meat rather than all animal products?\" White shirt: \"Vegan, vegetarian, what's the difference?\" Puzzled guy: \"Um, well, I *just* explained the difference. You know what? Never mind; it's none of my business anyway.\" Then someone pipes up \"Won't the egg mixture just run through the grill?\" \"Maybe they have a skillet?\" someone replied. \n\nAfter all the eggs were handed out everyone held hands and ate their eggs (with their faces pressed into the paper plates since they didn't have their hands free). It was the most beautiful thing I've ever witnessed; people of all genders coming together and eating scramble eggs with their faces. I shed a single tear and clapped, a slow non-sarcastic clap. My hands were free because I couldn't eat the eggs - I'm gluten intolerant. u/manic_eye</td><td>1506816015</td></tr><tr><td>dnqikf8</td><td>t1_dnqhw1y</td><td>1</td><td>t3_73euep</td><td>xaronax</td><td>AnimalsBeingDerps</td><td>I mean, if I was nice and pulled them aside or messaged them anonymously to let them know maybe.\n\nI'm talking full on Spongebob \"bAriSta\" \"eXpReSsO\" shit. lol.</td><td>1506816015</td></tr><tr><td>dnqikf9</td><td>t1_dnqibkx</td><td>12</td><td>t3_73hvrp</td><td>kirtas4life</td><td>TrollXChromosomes</td><td>Oh my god, yes - when we do laundry, we tend to throw the clean clothes into a pile on the floor of my craft room.

Either enslavement is the price of being saved, or the act of saving and the act of exploiting are separate. You can't have it both ways.\n\nThat's not how you've described the situation. If they offered him safety in exchange for becoming a slave, while he was floating through space, that would be a different issue. This would be the one case where the act of enslaving actually improves the situation.\n\n&gt;Here you are not comparing exploitation with slavery, you are comparing selling with slavery. Selling someone an apple is not exploitation.\n\nOK: You are starving and I sell you an apple for 100 000$. - I still improve your situation. \n\n&gt;Maintaining slavery requires constantly feeding, clothing and sheltering your slaves, so you are continuously improving their position. These acts are necessary to slavery, but slavery is not necessary to these acts.\n\nAh, but here's the rub! The only person who can judge the change in quality of the situation is the person themselves. If the upkeep produced an actual net improvement to the slave's situation, they would not need to be a slave - they would work voluntarily! The fact that a threat of violence is necessary to keep the slave working implies that maintaining slavery actually worsens their situation.\n\nFor slavery to be slavery (forced actions), a threat of force must be present. And this means that the slaver necessarily worsens the slave's situation to make them choose to work!</td><td>1506816016</td></tr><tr><td>dnqikga</td><td>t3_73hs99</td><td>3</td><td>t3_73hs99</td><td>LostRonin</td><td>electronic_cigarette</td><td>The Ello isn't going to blow your mind but it is one of the best included in a kit with very dependable coils.

If we take that Christianity is the correct religion ( instead of atheism or *insert a list of all other deistic ideology here*) then any given Christian has a 1 in 1000 shot at interpreting the dogma in the correct way as to not be a blasphemous hell bound sinner. \n\n&gt;What does it mean to be correct \n\nIn this case it means that of all available options, both past and present, you successfully chose the one that ends up being true. \n\n&gt;and furthermore, what does a sect of Christianity not practicing Christianity correctly mean to whether Christianity is correct? \n\nNothing. That's why I said that if we accept the **premise** that Christianity is correct, it still only gives any single practioner a one in 1000 shot at being right. It does not bear on wether or not Christians are right, that number was too astronomical to calculate. </td><td>1506816017</td></tr><tr><td>dnqikh1</td><td>t3_73c7oc</td><td>1</td><td>t3_73c7oc</td><td>ahfuah</td><td>FidgetSpinners</td><td>Send me a PM. :)</td><td>1506816017</td></tr><tr><td>dnqikh2</td><td>t1_dnqf0qz</td><td>2</td><td>t3_73fu6h</td><td>Phinocio</td><td>webdev</td><td>Yeah, this is why I'm not too upset about it, it's still a beta. </td><td>1506816017</td></tr><tr><td>dnqikh3</td><td>t1_dnpzlfk</td><td>23</td><td>t3_73dtlb</td><td>hyperoxerin</td><td>TalesFromRetail</td><td>Which makes sense.

M113s, Grizzly, Cougar and Husky armored vehicles, multiple artillery batteries, Air Force helicopters for infantry air assaults, air defense batteries, thousands of mortar rounds, the fucking FN, New MLVW's, Rambo tier amounts of M72's, parade squares that fit 1500 soldiers and full support battalions were normal things. Sometimes Reg force was fully/partially involved, sometimes they weren't.\n\nCompared to now. \nMaybe 300 or 400 reservists will go one exercise if the Land Force Area can afford it that year. No M113's, no LAV's, Shit ass LSVW/Milverado/G-Wagon/MLVW vehicles. No artillery except the 4 forty year old field guns that the artillery platoons have in the whole province. Maybe the Air Force will be able to afford to send out 1 or 2 unarmed helicopters for a day or two. Maybe the medics will set up a tent if they can get enough members to go on exercise. The food will come from the base kitchen or will be MRE's because the service battalions are incapable of getting enough people or equipment to provide those services. Any M72 training will be 35mm training insert on a reused tube. Your unit and the exerciser run out of training rounds so you literally say \"Bang Bang\" when \"shooting\". Soldiers get encouraged to stay home on range qualification days because their units can't afford to qualify everyone on even the C7 let alone the machine guns.\n\nThat same parade square has crumbled so much that it could only parade two under strength platoons. The military can't afford to fix it, and there is no point in fixing it really. The reserves totally depend on the Regular force as well.\n\n\nThat and the older aged higher ranking NCO's that are just riding it out to top up their pension.\n\n\nReservists are part time. If you are going to attract high quality and talented people to the reserves, it has to be fun. Why would anyone earn very little money one night a week and do basically nothing with not much opportunity stay?

Heck, many candy companies still have trade secrets today rather than patents. The idea isn't that IP protects competition, as competition would be fine without it.

How would you provide studies if the methodology and composition couldn't be known by third parties? NDAs are a modest solution but everyone has a price. Patents means the mode of action of a medicine is out in the open so it can *immediately* begin benefiting future science.\n\nTrade secrets are also, well, secrets. It incentivizes industrial espionage which is usually damaging and illegal and harmful.\n\nHowever IP as it currently exists has flaws. Right now the incentive is not to get a patent and get back to inventing because it is more profitable to get a patent and use it as a bludgeon to sue for damages and prevent others from innovating. Inventing and progress must wait on the patent to expire which does more harm to innovation than the patent protects. </td><td>1506816027</td></tr><tr><td>dnqikq0</td><td>t1_dnqgrcm</td><td>8</td><td>t3_73i76q</td><td>Thathuskerfan</td><td>Huskers</td><td>Agreed.

I doubt he was the first to pioneer it but I've always called them Wheeler handles or Wheeler knock off's because he does it correctly while the majority fall short.\n\nI love the look of these handles in photo's but the pinky swell is almost always too wide/fat for my tastes. Not a fan of having my index grip tighter than my pinky's. I prefer an equal grip across the handle or slight tapering towards the rear.\n\nI understand the idea behind the design but it is actually counter intuitive for such a small knife. The flair is better suited on a chopper above 10\" in blade length. Think Kukri handles.\n\nIf my pinky doesn't touch or nearly touch the inside of my palm when I grip it, it's too fat and diminish the overall grip. I'm not a big guy but I have piano fingers and if the blade wont fit my hand it wont fit a 6' 5\" mans hand correctly either with there extra body fat.\n\nIf you want a great example of these in slight variations look too Nick Wheeler. He does it right. You'll notice the pinky swell on most of his models are obviously smaller than the index grip unlike the one in the linked photo. And if they are not they are more dramatically shaped at the rear. Doesn't look as pretty but I feel it's more practical.\n\nHere's a great [example](https://www.instagram.com/p/BXwy6dKFuew/?taken-by=nick_wheeler_knives_and_newfs). It may be hard to tell for some but that extra meat being removed will make a world of difference in the hand.\n\nQuick test for people at home. Hold your hand up. Is your pinky as long as your index? If no then the swell should not be thicker than your index unless your intention is to make a chopper. Equal grip across the boards makes for a more versatile grip but the blades shape truly dictates the knifes usage so plan accordingly.",1506816009,1],["asoiaf","dnqik93","t1_dnqefo4",17,"t3_73e5oq","SonOfYossarian","Yeah.

There is an office supply store near me that still has 9.7 inch iPad Pros on display as well as the new iPad 2017, and I'm not kidding, I thought they mislabeled the demo units. I was so convinced they had swapped the labels on the demo units that I had to put the serial numbers in a search engine to verify that the iPad 2017 and the iPad Pro 9.7 were properly labeled.\n\nIf you know what to look for, it's more clear, but it is hard to tell the units apart if you're doing it for the first time.\n\nIncidentally, the screen on the iPad 2017 is not \"bad\". In fact, if you Google the Notebookcheck measurements of the screen, it's actually quite accurate. (In terms of measured DeltaE within the sRGB gamut, both grey and color, it's actually better than the measurements Notebookcheck got for the 10.5 iPad Pro -- though individual numbers aren't everything and there will obviously be variation between panels.)\n\nTwo good things about the iPad 2017 that I've noticed: \n\n* There is less color variation severely off-angle than both generations of the iPad Pros. I think this is due to the difference in coatings, or perhaps the presence of the sensing layer for the Apple Pencil.\n\n* The anti-fingerprint oleophobic coating on the iPad 2017 is definitely more effective than on the Pros. I think they had to compromise there to support the Apple Pencil.\n\nThere is a little more brightness variation on the iPad 2017 in comparison to the Pros, and of course there is no support for an extended gamut or 120 Hz. But on the positive side, I find the iPad 2017 is easier to hold in the hand because of the bezel size and the slightly smaller screen is better for reading eBooks.\n\nI wouldn't hesitate to buy the iPad 2017.

A rib cooker singles out some young guy wearing a white \"Where's the beef?\" T-shirt, standing off to the side. He says \"Hey buddy! That T-shirt ain't going to stay white for long\" as he points to his immaculately clean white apron, confusing those watching the exchange. The young guy says \"oh, I won't be *eating* any ribs\", and honestly his emphasis of the word *eating* creeped me out a bit, but whatever. So the cook huddles with associates and seem to come to some type of agreement and calls back over to the young guy \"Hey Buddy! Come here a minute!\" So he walks over and the cook turns on a loud white noise machine and we can't hear what they're saying. After a lot of emphatic hand waving, head nodding &amp; shaking, and some frantic scribbling and erasing on a white board, the young man walks over to the rib line (which is pretty long at this point since no one's been serving ribs). Everyone in line does a triple-take as the man takes his place in line, and the whole line is now murmuring to each other trying to make sense of it all. Someone finally incredulously asks \"What could the cook *possibly* have said to you to convince you to eat after you already declined one single time?!?\" The man smiles and says \"Well you see, I'm a VEGAN and can't eat meat, so the cook had offered to clean off the grill and make me some scrambled eggs instead.\" And one of the people in line says \"I didn't know they had scrambled eggs! I want that\". Others joined in \"Me too!\" \"I'll pay double!\" \"Triple!\" \"Money is no object!\" It was pandemonium. Another man stands in line with very puzzled look on his face. The line continues to swell as more people hear the rumor of scramble eggs and eventually all the Vegans at Ribfest make their way to the line. Finally, the puzzled man speaks up, \"Excuse me, I know this is none of my business, but do you mean vegetarian?\" The original white shirt guy gives his own puzzled look in return. So the puzzled man clarifies \"Well it's just that you said you're a vegan but you're about to eat eggs, which are an animal product - plus I think there's probably milk in it too if they're doing it right\" Someone else shouts \"And vanilla extract!\" And the puzzled guy says \"Yeah, maybe. But that's not an animal product. Anyways, I think maybe you meant vegetarian rather than vegan, since it sounds like you don't eat meat rather than all animal products?\" White shirt: \"Vegan, vegetarian, what's the difference?\" Puzzled guy: \"Um, well, I *just* explained the difference. You know what? Never mind; it's none of my business anyway.\" Then someone pipes up \"Won't the egg mixture just run through the grill?\" \"Maybe they have a skillet?\" someone replied. \n\nAfter all the eggs were handed out everyone held hands and ate their eggs (with their faces pressed into the paper plates since they didn't have their hands free). It was the most beautiful thing I've ever witnessed; people of all genders coming together and eating scramble eggs with their faces. I shed a single tear and clapped, a slow non-sarcastic clap.

Except for that one time that she covered herself in bird poop on the playground somehow.  I thought it was hilarious.\n\nThe worst part is having to pre-make food for her every single day.  Breakfast, AM Snack, Lunch, and PM Snack. So tiring!

M113s, Grizzly, Cougar and Husky armored vehicles, multiple artillery batteries, Air Force helicopters for infantry air assaults, air defense batteries, thousands of mortar rounds, the fucking FN, New MLVW's, Rambo tier amounts of M72's, parade squares that fit 1500 soldiers and full support battalions were normal things. Sometimes Reg force was fully/partially involved, sometimes they weren't.\n\nCompared to now. \nMaybe 300 or 400 reservists will go one exercise if the Land Force Area can afford it that year. No M113's, no LAV's, Shit ass LSVW/Milverado/G-Wagon/MLVW vehicles. No artillery except the 4 forty year old field guns that the artillery platoons have in the whole province. Maybe the Air Force will be able to afford to send out 1 or 2 unarmed helicopters for a day or two. Maybe the medics will set up a tent if they can get enough members to go on exercise. The food will come from the base kitchen or will be MRE's because the service battalions are incapable of getting enough people or equipment to provide those services. Any M72 training will be 35mm training insert on a reused tube. Your unit and the exerciser run out of training rounds so you literally say \"Bang Bang\" when \"shooting\". Soldiers get encouraged to stay home on range qualification days because their units can't afford to qualify everyone on even the C7 let alone the machine guns.\n\nThat same parade square has crumbled so much that it could only parade two under strength platoons. The military can't afford to fix it, and there is no point in fixing it really. The reserves totally depend on the Regular force as well.\n\n\nThat and the older aged higher ranking NCO's that are just riding it out to top up their pension.\n\n\nReservists are part time.

Right now the incentive is not to get a patent and get back to inventing because it is more profitable to get a patent and use it as a bludgeon to sue for damages and prevent others from innovating.

It seems this form of corrupt government certainly has a limited life-span.

In this sense you defend an action taken in response to their thinking, just not the kind of action. The kind of thinking that leads to genocide is not rational, its not sensible, and its not fair. There is no just motive that makes people believe in mass rape. That is hate. Your entire premise is that there's a just way to think of another people in a way that can make you want to do this.\n\n&gt;which is that you think I'm excusing rape\n\nOn some level you are to an extent. Its like if someone said \"so and so got raped by her ex\" and someone replied \"well she did screw him over hard in the divorce\". You know saying that is fucked up and you know the impulse to consider the action that way and then express it says something terrible about how the speaker is envisioning the dynamics of the relationship.\n\nWhen people are tried for crimes the things you're saying are used as mitigation. The reasoning behind an act is used to lessen or strengthen the condemnation and ensuing punishment for the act. On any level where you look at how our value system manifests judgment for actions taken you are mitigating it.\n\n&gt;The problem with your argument is that nowhere did I say I supported the how of the Burmese actions\n\nI already acknowledged that. I said that doesn't matter and I have explained why.

I doubt he was the first to pioneer it but I've always called them Wheeler handles or Wheeler knock off's because he does it correctly while the majority fall short.\n\nI love the look of these handles in photo's but the pinky swell is almost always too wide/fat for my tastes. Not a fan of having my index grip tighter than my pinky's. I prefer an equal grip across the handle or slight tapering towards the rear.\n\nI understand the idea behind the design but it is actually counter intuitive for such a small knife. The flair is better suited on a chopper above 10\" in blade length. Think Kukri handles.\n\nIf my pinky doesn't touch or nearly touch the inside of my palm when I grip it, it's too fat and diminish the overall grip. I'm not a big guy but I have piano fingers and if the blade wont fit my hand it wont fit a 6' 5\" mans hand correctly either with there extra body fat.\n\nIf you want a great example of these in slight variations look too Nick Wheeler. He does it right. You'll notice the pinky swell on most of his models are obviously smaller than the index grip unlike the one in the linked photo. And if they are not they are more dramatically shaped at the rear. Doesn't look as pretty but I feel it's more practical.\n\nHere's a great [example](https://www.instagram.com/p/BXwy6dKFuew/?taken-by=nick_wheeler_knives_and_newfs). It may be hard to tell for some but that extra meat being removed will make a world of difference in the hand.\n\nQuick test for people at home. Hold your hand up. Is your pinky as long as your index? If no then the swell should not be thicker than your index unless your intention is to make a chopper. Equal grip across the boards makes for a more versatile grip but the blades shape truly dictates the knifes usage so plan accordingly.</td><td>1506816009</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>asoiaf</td><td>dnqik93</td><td>t1_dnqefo4</td><td>17</td><td>t3_73e5oq</td><td>SonOfYossarian</td><td>Yeah.

Show me where I said abandon your mortgage, kids and wife.\n\nYou stated to leave the premises, by virtue of American law, having left the premises is considered abandonment of the home and the children in the home. This is well proven through the amazingly broken family court system. \n\nIf you leave the home, you can pretty much write off ever seeing your children again unless you are independently wealthy and the wife/girlfriend does not have access to the accounts. \n\n&gt;I’ve about had my fill of Internet warriors who put words in people’s mouths, instead of owning their assumptions and having an adult conversion.\n\nI made no assumptions, you said to leave the premises, then you said you didn't mean it, that it was \"figurative\". \n\nSay what you mean and you won't have all of these \"internet warriors\" putting words in your mouth. In fact, if it happens so often, perhaps you should stop bitching about it, and start asking why it is that your statements are so often incorrectly read differently than you meant them. \n\n&gt;So, please, fucking show me how I minced words.\n\nOK.\n\nYou said. \n\n&gt;Woman hits you, you leave the premise one way or another.\n\n\nThen you stated what that meant was:\n\n&gt; I didn’t mean, “leave right now and never look back”. More like, walk out of the room or building to let things simmer down a bit.\n\n\nTo which I reminded you that in the American legal system, doing so is seen as willful abandonment and will count against you in court the majority of the time. \n\nSo first you said leave the premises, then said you didn't mean to literally leave, just go to another room. Cause women can only hit you standing in one spot, they could never possibly follow you. It's their one weakness right. \n\nAs an aside, you have made the mistake numerous times now, it is \"premises\", not \"premise\".

There is an office supply store near me that still has 9.7 inch iPad Pros on display as well as the new iPad 2017, and I'm not kidding, I thought they mislabeled the demo units. I was so convinced they had swapped the labels on the demo units that I had to put the serial numbers in a search engine to verify that the iPad 2017 and the iPad Pro 9.7 were properly labeled.\n\nIf you know what to look for, it's more clear, but it is hard to tell the units apart if you're doing it for the first time.\n\nIncidentally, the screen on the iPad 2017 is not \"bad\". In fact, if you Google the Notebookcheck measurements of the screen, it's actually quite accurate. (In terms of measured DeltaE within the sRGB gamut, both grey and color, it's actually better than the measurements Notebookcheck got for the 10.5 iPad Pro -- though individual numbers aren't everything and there will obviously be variation between panels.)\n\nTwo good things about the iPad 2017 that I've noticed: \n\n* There is less color variation severely off-angle than both generations of the iPad Pros. I think this is due to the difference in coatings, or perhaps the presence of the sensing layer for the Apple Pencil.\n\n* The anti-fingerprint oleophobic coating on the iPad 2017 is definitely more effective than on the Pros. I think they had to compromise there to support the Apple Pencil.\n\nThere is a little more brightness variation on the iPad 2017 in comparison to the Pros, and of course there is no support for an extended gamut or 120 Hz. But on the positive side, I find the iPad 2017 is easier to hold in the hand because of the bezel size and the slightly smaller screen is better for reading eBooks.\n\nI wouldn't hesitate to buy the iPad 2017. I think it's one of the best deals Apple has ever offered.</td><td>1506816015</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>dankmemes</td><td>dnqiket</td><td>t3_73hs64</td><td>1</td><td>t3_73hs64</td><td>SkShark</td><td>r/me_irl</td><td>1506816015</td><td>13</td></tr><tr><td>StarWarsBattlefront</td><td>dnqikeu</td><td>t1_dnownvv</td><td>1</td><td>t3_736uui</td><td>MTsumi</td><td>I don't know, I think the xim4 is a pretty good one.

A rib cooker singles out some young guy wearing a white \"Where's the beef?\" T-shirt, standing off to the side. He says \"Hey buddy! That T-shirt ain't going to stay white for long\" as he points to his immaculately clean white apron, confusing those watching the exchange. The young guy says \"oh, I won't be *eating* any ribs\", and honestly his emphasis of the word *eating* creeped me out a bit, but whatever. So the cook huddles with associates and seem to come to some type of agreement and calls back over to the young guy \"Hey Buddy! Come here a minute!\" So he walks over and the cook turns on a loud white noise machine and we can't hear what they're saying. After a lot of emphatic hand waving, head nodding &amp; shaking, and some frantic scribbling and erasing on a white board, the young man walks over to the rib line (which is pretty long at this point since no one's been serving ribs). Everyone in line does a triple-take as the man takes his place in line, and the whole line is now murmuring to each other trying to make sense of it all. Someone finally incredulously asks \"What could the cook *possibly* have said to you to convince you to eat after you already declined one single time?!?\" The man smiles and says \"Well you see, I'm a VEGAN and can't eat meat, so the cook had offered to clean off the grill and make me some scrambled eggs instead.\" And one of the people in line says \"I didn't know they had scrambled eggs! I want that\". Others joined in \"Me too!\" \"I'll pay double!\" \"Triple!\" \"Money is no object!\" It was pandemonium. Another man stands in line with very puzzled look on his face. The line continues to swell as more people hear the rumor of scramble eggs and eventually all the Vegans at Ribfest make their way to the line. Finally, the puzzled man speaks up, \"Excuse me, I know this is none of my business, but do you mean vegetarian?\" The original white shirt guy gives his own puzzled look in return. So the puzzled man clarifies \"Well it's just that you said you're a vegan but you're about to eat eggs, which are an animal product - plus I think there's probably milk in it too if they're doing it right\" Someone else shouts \"And vanilla extract!\" And the puzzled guy says \"Yeah, maybe. But that's not an animal product. Anyways, I think maybe you meant vegetarian rather than vegan, since it sounds like you don't eat meat rather than all animal products?\" White shirt: \"Vegan, vegetarian, what's the difference?\" Puzzled guy: \"Um, well, I *just* explained the difference. You know what? Never mind; it's none of my business anyway.\" Then someone pipes up \"Won't the egg mixture just run through the grill?\" \"Maybe they have a skillet?\" someone replied. \n\nAfter all the eggs were handed out everyone held hands and ate their eggs (with their faces pressed into the paper plates since they didn't have their hands free). It was the most beautiful thing I've ever witnessed; people of all genders coming together and eating scramble eggs with their faces. I shed a single tear and clapped, a slow non-sarcastic clap.

Either enslavement is the price of being saved, or the act of saving and the act of exploiting are separate. You can't have it both ways.\n\nThat's not how you've described the situation. If they offered him safety in exchange for becoming a slave, while he was floating through space, that would be a different issue. This would be the one case where the act of enslaving actually improves the situation.\n\n&gt;Here you are not comparing exploitation with slavery, you are comparing selling with slavery. Selling someone an apple is not exploitation.\n\nOK: You are starving and I sell you an apple for 100 000$. - I still improve your situation. \n\n&gt;Maintaining slavery requires constantly feeding, clothing and sheltering your slaves, so you are continuously improving their position. These acts are necessary to slavery, but slavery is not necessary to these acts.\n\nAh, but here's the rub! The only person who can judge the change in quality of the situation is the person themselves. If the upkeep produced an actual net improvement to the slave's situation, they would not need to be a slave - they would work voluntarily! The fact that a threat of violence is necessary to keep the slave working implies that maintaining slavery actually worsens their situation.\n\nFor slavery to be slavery (forced actions), a threat of force must be present.

M113s, Grizzly, Cougar and Husky armored vehicles, multiple artillery batteries, Air Force helicopters for infantry air assaults, air defense batteries, thousands of mortar rounds, the fucking FN, New MLVW's, Rambo tier amounts of M72's, parade squares that fit 1500 soldiers and full support battalions were normal things. Sometimes Reg force was fully/partially involved, sometimes they weren't.\n\nCompared to now. \nMaybe 300 or 400 reservists will go one exercise if the Land Force Area can afford it that year. No M113's, no LAV's, Shit ass LSVW/Milverado/G-Wagon/MLVW vehicles. No artillery except the 4 forty year old field guns that the artillery platoons have in the whole province. Maybe the Air Force will be able to afford to send out 1 or 2 unarmed helicopters for a day or two. Maybe the medics will set up a tent if they can get enough members to go on exercise. The food will come from the base kitchen or will be MRE's because the service battalions are incapable of getting enough people or equipment to provide those services. Any M72 training will be 35mm training insert on a reused tube. Your unit and the exerciser run out of training rounds so you literally say \"Bang Bang\" when \"shooting\". Soldiers get encouraged to stay home on range qualification days because their units can't afford to qualify everyone on even the C7 let alone the machine guns.\n\nThat same parade square has crumbled so much that it could only parade two under strength platoons. The military can't afford to fix it, and there is no point in fixing it really. The reserves totally depend on the Regular force as well.\n\n\nThat and the older aged higher ranking NCO's that are just riding it out to top up their pension.\n\n\nReservists are part time. If you are going to attract high quality and talented people to the reserves, it has to be fun. Why would anyone earn very little money one night a week and do basically nothing with not much opportunity stay?

The upside of afternoon sun is that it will support a wide variety of colorful plants: annuals like fancy trailing geraniums and sun resistant coleus (Trailing Plum is pretty and dependable http://davesgarden.com/guides/pf/go/57816/) in hanging baskets. In pots, you could grow dwarf zinnias, dwarf to mid-height snapdragons, petunias in a zillion colors and patterns, and sun resistant impatience like SunPatiens (http://www.costafarms.com/plants/impatiens-sunpatiens) for color.\n\nSomething I tried for the first time this year that was super cute and unusual was dwarf eucomis or pineapple lilies.

Heck, many candy companies still have trade secrets today rather than patents. The idea isn't that IP protects competition, as competition would be fine without it. The issue is that IP provides other benefits besides rent seeking to innovators, advantages that aren't talked about.\n\nImagine modern medicine with trade secrets. There's no way for it to work. How would you provide studies if the methodology and composition couldn't be known by third parties? NDAs are a modest solution but everyone has a price. Patents means the mode of action of a medicine is out in the open so it can *immediately* begin benefiting future science.\n\nTrade secrets are also, well, secrets. It incentivizes industrial espionage which is usually damaging and illegal and harmful.\n\nHowever IP as it currently exists has flaws. Right now the incentive is not to get a patent and get back to inventing because it is more profitable to get a patent and use it as a bludgeon to sue for damages and prevent others from innovating. Inventing and progress must wait on the patent to expire which does more harm to innovation than the patent protects. </td><td>1506816027</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Huskers</td><td>dnqikq0</td><td>t1_dnqgrcm</td><td>8</td><td>t3_73i76q</td><td>Thathuskerfan</td><td>Agreed.
